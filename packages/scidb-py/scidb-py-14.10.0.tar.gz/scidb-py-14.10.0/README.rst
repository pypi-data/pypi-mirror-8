SciDB-py: Python Interface to SciDB
===================================
SciDB-py is a full-featuered Python interface to SciDB.  Its goal is to
allow users to utilize the power of SciDB_ from Python, using a familiar
and intuitive numpy-like syntax.  For more information, see the
SciDB Documentation_.

Requirements
------------
SciDB-Py requires a working SciDB_ installation, as well as a
Shim_ network interface connected to the instance.  It requires
Python 2.6-2.7 or 3.3.

Package Dependencies
--------------------
SciDB-Py has several Python package dependencies:

NumPy_
    tested with version 1.7.

Requests_
    tested with version 1.2.
    (Note: known failures exist when used with requests version < 1.0)
    Required for using the Shim interface to SciDB.

Pandas_ (optional)
    tested with version 0.10.
    Required only for importing/exporting SciDB arrays
    as Pandas Dataframe objects.

SciPy_ (optional)
    tested with versions 0.10-0.12.
    Required only for importing/exporting SciDB arrays
    as SciPy sparse matrices.

Test Dependencies
-----------------
Mock_
    Required for some tests

Installation
------------
For full installation information, please see the Documentation_.

To install the latest stable release via the Python Package Index, use
```
pip install --upgrade scidb-py
```

To download the source code for the 14.8 release, change 'branch:master' to 'tag:v14.8.1' and then click 'download', or
directly download from https://github.com/Paradigm4/SciDB-py/archive/v14.8.1.zip

To install from source after downloading, type
```
python setup.py install
```

Depending on how your Python installation is set up, you
may need root privileges for this.
