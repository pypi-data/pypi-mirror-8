Django-rstamper - Installation instructions
===========================================

Creating an enviroment for your project
---------------------------------------

You have to create an environment where everything will be installed.
Create first the directory where the environment will be created and
enter in the enviroment:

::
    $ mkdir myproject
    $ cd myproject
    $ virtualenv --distribute env
    $ source env/bin/activate


Creating a new django project
-----------------------------

Once you're into the enviroment, next step involves creating a new
django project. So, being inside the virtual environment, we must
install django (required dependency, of course) and then, create the project:

::

    $ pip install django


Installing Django-rstamper
-----------------------------

Now we have a real project, we're ready to import Django-rstamper, so
we can handle it managing the following pip command:

::

    $ pip install django-rstamper

Configuring project
-------------------

We have to configure a new project. The package is provided with a
sample Django app (rstamper-example), so we can use it (if you want to start from
scratch). Otherwise you have to "merge" the urls.py and settings.py files:

::

    $ cp -r env/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rstamper/rstamper-example/ src/
    $ cd src/
    $ python manage.py syncdb
    $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000


::
    http://localhost:8000/rstamper/
    http://localhost:8000/admin/rstamper/

Templates
---------

If you want to override the templates you only have to copy them from
sample Django app (rstamper-example) to your project and change all what
you need.
