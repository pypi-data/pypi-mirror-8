kaplot is a plotting tool built around ``matplotlib``. It combines the
flexibilty and fantastic plot generation potention of ``matplotlib`` with an
easier to use, object oriented, interface. The interface is simple
enough to quickly prototype plots, or fine tune for publication quality
results.

Detailed documentation is hosted on `GitHub`_. The package contains 2
modules:

-  kaplot is the main module, which contains the kaplot class for
   plotting.

   -  kaplot.defaults is a submodule which contains a couple of pre-made
      plot settings, which are passed as an argument to the kaplot
      object. More information (including making your own settings file)
      is available in the documentation

-  kaplot\_backend is a module which allows for selecting a custom
   ``matplotlib`` `backend`_.
