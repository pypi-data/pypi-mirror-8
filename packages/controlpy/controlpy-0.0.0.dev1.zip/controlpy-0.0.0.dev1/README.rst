Controlpy
=========

A library for commonly used controls algorithms (e.g. creating LQR controllers). An alternative to Richard Murray's "control" package -- however, here we do not require Slycot.

The goals of this are:

1) Allow me to easily design control systems in Python

2) Learn some more about Python

3) Maybe provide something useful to other people.

How to install
--------------
1) Clone this repository somewhere convenient: `git clone https://github.com/markwmuller/controlpy.git`
2) Install the package (we'll do a "develop" install, so any changes are immediately available):  `python setup.py develop` (you'll probably need to be administrator)
3) You're ready to go: try running the examples in the `example` folder.
