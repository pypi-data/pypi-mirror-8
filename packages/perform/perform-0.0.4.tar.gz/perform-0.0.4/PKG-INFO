Description: 
        Perform is for calling processes from python in a simple and easy way.  Each program is added to the perform module as a function that returns the stdout printed by the program.
        
        Examples:
        To call a normal program that whose name doesn't contain symbols:
            stdout = perform.ls()
        
        To pass arguments to a program:
            stdout = perform.git("ls-files", "-m")
        
        To call a program that contains symbols in its name:
            stdout = perform._("pip2.7", "install", "perform")
        
        To get stderr from a program:
            try:
                perform.git("asdad")
            except Exception as e:
                print(str(e))
        
        To call a command in the shell:
            print(perform._("ls | grep 'py'", shell=True))
