Description: Buildout Extension to strip binaries
        ====================================
        
        slapos.extension.strip is a buildout extension that finds shared
        libraries, binary executables and static libraries, and calls strip(1)
        against them to reduce the size. It is triggered at the end of the
        buildout process.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add ``slapos.extension.strip`` in ``[buildout]`` section's ``extensions`` option like :
        
        ::
        
          [buildout]
          extensions = slapos.extension.strip
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The following programs are required. If any of them is missing, this
        extension does nothing.
        
        - ``file``
        - ``find``
        - ``strip``
