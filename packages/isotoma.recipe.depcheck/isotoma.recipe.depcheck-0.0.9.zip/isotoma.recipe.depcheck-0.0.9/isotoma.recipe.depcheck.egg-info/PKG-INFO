Description: Dependency checker buildout recipe
        ==================================
        
        If you are relying on the OS to provide some facilities for your software, this
        recipe can help verify that the dependencies exist.
        
        The recipe can check for any of the following:
        
            * If certain files exist in the filesystem and that they are executable
            * If certain locales are available on the system
            * If buildout is being run as a particular user
            * If certain users are present on the system
            * If buildout is being run by any of a list of python versions
        
        Note that locales are checked in an Ubuntu-specific way, so may not work for
        you.
        
        If any dependencies fail, and the "action" option isn't set to "warn", the
        recipe will raise an exception.
        
        An example::
        
            [foo]
            program = /usr/sbin/foo
        
            [bar]
            binary = /usr/sbin/bar
            locale = nl_NL.UTF-8
        
            [dependencies]
            recipe = isotoma.recipe.depcheck
            executable = 
                ${foo:program}
                ${bar:binary}
            locale = ${bar:locale}
            current-user = webappuser
            users =
                taskqueue
                www-data
            python =
                2.5
                2.6
                2.7
            action = warn
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        
        executable
            A list of one or more paths to files that must be executable
        directory
            A list of one or more paths to inodes that must exist and be directories
        file
            A list of one or more paths to inodes that must exist and be files
        locale-file
            The name of a file on disk to look for locales in (defaults to the Ubuntu location)
        locale
            A list of one or more locales to check are in locale-file
        current-user
            Ensures that buildout is being run by the user specified.
        users
            A list of users that must have accounts on the local system. (Users must 
            be present in /etc/passwd)
        python
            A list of python versions that buildout be executed under (useful if your
            application is py2.4-only, etc.)
        action
            Either "warn" or "fail". The default is to "fail" if a dependency isn't met.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.0.9 (2014-11-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix support for older pythons.
        
        
        0.0.8 (2014-11-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Use the output of locales command if required.
        
        
        0.0.7 (2013-01-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Checking for executables would error out if the file was missing. Now only
          tries to stat the file if it is there.
        
        
        0.0.6 (2012-04-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        0.0.5 (2011-09-09)
        ------------------
        
        - The locale option was opening and parsing the (ubuntu) locales file each time
          the recipe was run, regardless of whether or not the user specified "locale ="
          Now it doesn't.
        
        0.0.4 (2011-09-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Check dependencies when the recipe's __init__ method is called, not the
          install method, so that dependency checks are run as early as possible.
        
        
        0.0.3 (2011-09-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Report on all dependency requirements prior to raising a UserError
        - The buildout-created bin/test now runs the unit recipe's unit tests
        - Added option "action = warn" (default is "action = fail") to just alert the
          user to dependency failures, but allow the buildout to continue.
        - Added option "current-user", to ensure that the buildout is being run as the
          required system user, e.g. "django".
        - Added option "users" to ensure that particular users are present on the system
          WARNING however that this retrieves its user list from /etc/passwd, so LDAP
          and the likes are not supported.
        - Added option "python" to check that the correct python version is being used.
          Multiple python versions are allowed, one-per-line. Only major and minor
          version numbers are accounted for, i.e. 2.6, NOT 2.6.3.
        
        
        0.0.2 (2011-08-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Better error handling
