Description: # ulutil
        
        This is a collection of utilities I found useful during the course of my
        research in the Church lab.  It is an upstream dependency for the `vdj`
        package, and was used to make lots of figures, etc.
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install ulutil
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/churchlab/ulutil.git
        cd ulutil
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        There may be varied dependencies for the different submodules.
