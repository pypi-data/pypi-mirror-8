""" Introduction
--------------------
This package provides tools for estimating multidimensional 
integrals numerically using an enhanced version of 
the adaptive Monte Carlo |vegas| algorithm (G. P. Lepage, 
J. Comput. Phys. 27(1978) 192).

A |vegas| code generally involves two objects, one representing
the integrand and the other representing an integration 
operator for a particular multidimensional volume. A typical
code sequence for a D-dimensional integral has the structure::

    # create the integrand
    def f(x):
        ... compute the integrand at point x[d] d=0,1...D-1 
        ...

    # create an integrator for volume with 
    # xl0 <= x[0] <= xu0, xl1 <= x[1] <= xu1 ...
    integration_region = [[xl0, xu0], [xl1, xu1], ...]
    integrator = vegas.Integrator(integration_region)

    # do the integral and print out the result
    result = integrator(f, nitn=10, neval=10000)
    print(result)

The algorithm iteratively adapts to the integrand over
``nitn`` iterations, each of which uses at most ``neval`` 
integrand samples to generate a Monte Carlo estimate of 
the integral. The final result is the weighted average 
of the results from all iterations. Increase ``neval`` 
to increase the precision of the result. Typically 
``nitn`` is between 10 and 20. ``neval`` can be
1000s to millions, or more, depending upon
the integrand and the precision desired.

The integrator remembers how it adapted to ``f(x)``
and uses this information as its starting point if it is reapplied 
to ``f(x)`` or applied to some other function ``g(x)``.
An integrator's state can be archived for future applications
using Python's :mod:`pickle` module.
