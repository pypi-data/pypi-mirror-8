Introduction
-------------

Class :class:`vegas.Integrator` gives Monte Carlo estimates of arbitrary
multidimensional integrals using the *vegas* algorithm 
(G. P. Lepage, J. Comput. Phys. 27 (1978) 192).  
The algorithm has two components.
First an automatic transformation is applied to to the integration variables
in an attempt to flatten the integrand. Then a Monte Carlo estimate of the
integral is made using the  transformed variables. Flattening the integrand
makes the integral easier and improves the estimate.  The transformation
applied to the integration variables is optimized
over several iterations of the algorithm: information about the integrand that
is collected during one iteration is used to  improve the transformation used
in the next iteration.

Monte Carlo integration makes few assumptions about the 
integrand --- it needn't be analytic nor even continuous. This
makes Monte Carlo integation unusually robust. It also makes it well suited
for adaptive integration. Adaptive strategies are essential for
multidimensional integration, especially in high dimensions, because
multidimensional space is large, with  lots of corners, making it 
easy to lose important features in the integrand. 

Monte Carlo integration also provides efficient and reliable methods for
estimating the 
accuracy of its results. In particular, each Monte Carlo
estimate of an integral is a random number from a distribution
whose mean is the correct value of the integral. This distribution is
Gaussian or normal provided 
the number of integrand samples is sufficiently large. 
In practive we generate multiple
estimates of the integral
in order to verify that the distribution is indeed Gaussian. 
Error analysis is straightforward if the
integral estimates are Gaussian.

The |vegas| algorithm has been in use for decades and implementations are
available in many programming languages, including Fortran (the original
version), C and C++. The algorithm used here is significantly improved over
the original implementation, and that used in most other implementations.
It uses two adaptive strategies: importance sampling, as in the original
implementation, and adaptive stratified sampling, which is new.

This module is written in Cython, so it is almost as fast as compiled Fortran or
C, particularly when the integrand is also coded in Cython (or some other
compiled language), as discussed below.

The following sections describe how to use |vegas|. Almost every 
example shown is a complete code, which can be copied into a file 
and run with python. It is worthwhile playing with the parameters to see how
things change.

*About Printing:* The examples in this tutorial use the print function as it is
used in Python 3. Drop the outermost parenthesis in each print statement if
using Python 2, or add ::

    from __future__ import print_function

at the start of your file.


Basic Integrals
----------------
Here we illustrate the use of |vegas| by estimating the integral

.. math::

    C\int_{-1}^1 dx_0 \int_0^1 dx_1 \int_0^1 dx_2 \int_0^1 dx_3
    \,\,\mathrm{e}^{- 100 \sum_{d}(x_d-0.5)^2}  ,

where constant :math:`C` is chosen so that the exact integral is 1. 
The following code shows how this can be done::

    import vegas
    import math

    def f(x): 
        dx2 = 0 
        for d in range(4): 
            dx2 += (x[d] - 0.5) ** 2
        return math.exp(-dx2 * 100.) * 1013.2118364296088

    integ = vegas.Integrator([[-1, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]])

    result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=1000)
    print(result.summary())
    print('result = %s    Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))

First we define the integrand ``f(x)`` where ``x[d]`` specifies a  point in the
4-dimensional space. We then create an  integrator, ``integ``, which is an
integration operator  that can be applied to any 4-dimensional function. It is
where we specify the integration volume. 
Finally we apply ``integ`` to our integrand ``f(x)``,
telling the integrator to estimate  the integral using ``nitn=10`` iterations
of the |vegas| algorithm, each of which uses no more than ``neval=1000``
evaluations of the integrand. Each iteration produces an independent
estimate of the integral. The final estimate is the weighted average of
the results from all 10 iterations, and is returned by ``integ(f ...)``.
The call ``result.summary()`` returns 
a summary of results from each iteration.

This code produces the following output:

.. literalinclude:: eg1a.out

There are several things to note here:

    **Adaptation:** Integration estimates are shown for
    each of the 10 iterations,
    giving both the estimate from just that iteration, and the weighted
    average of results from all iterations up to that point. The
    estimates from the first two iterations are not accurate at
    all, with errors equal to 30--190% of the final result. 
    |vegas| initially has no information about the integrand
    and so does a relatively poor job of estimating the integral.
    It uses information from the samples in one iteration, however,
    to remap the integration variables for subsequent iterations,
    concentrating samples where the function is largest and reducing 
    errors. 
    As a result, the per-iteration error
    is reduced to 4.3% by the fifth iteration, and below 2% by
    the end --- an improvement by almost two orders of 
    magnitude from the start. Eventually the per-iteration error
    stops decreasing because |vegas| has found the optimal remapping, 
    at which point
    it has fully adapted to the integrand.

    **Weighted Average:** The final result, 1.0015 Â± 0.0091, 
    is obtained from a weighted
    average of the separate results from each iteration:
    estimates are weighted by the inverse variance, thereby giving
    much less weight to the early iterations, where the errors are
    largest.
    The individual estimates are statistical: each
    is a random number drawn from a distribution whose mean
    equals the correct value of the integral, and the errors 
    quoted are estimates of the standard deviations of those
    distributions. The distributions are Gaussian provided 
    the number of integrand evaluations per iteration (``neval``)
    is sufficiently large, in which case the standard deviation
    is a reliable estimate of the error.
    The weighted average :math:`\overline I`  minimizes

    .. math::

      \chi^2 \,\equiv\, \sum_i \frac{(I_i - \overline I)^2}{\sigma_{i}^2}

    where :math:`I_i \pm \sigma_{i}` are the estimates from 
    individual iterations. If the :math:`I_i` are Gaussian, 
    :math:`\chi^2` should be of order the number of degrees of 
    freedom (plus or minus the square root of that number);
    here the number of degrees of freedom is the number of 
    iterations minus 1. 

    The distributions are likely non-Gaussian, and error estimates
    unreliable, if |chi2| is
    much larger than the number of iterations. This criterion is quantified
    by the *Q* or *p-value* of the :math:`\chi^2`,
    which is the probability that a
    larger :math:`\chi^2` could result from random (Gaussian)
    fluctuations. A very small *Q* (less than 0.05-0.1) indicates
    that the :math:`\chi^2` is too large to be accounted for by
    statistical fluctuations --- that is, the estimates of the integral
    from different iterations do not agree with each other to 
    within errors. This means that ``neval`` is not sufficiently
    large to guarantee Gaussian behavior, and must be increased
    if the error estimates are to be trusted.


    ``integ(f...)`` returns a weighted-average object,
    of type :class:`vegas.RAvg`, that has the following 
    attributes:

      ``result.mean`` --- weighted average of all estimates of the integral;
      
      ``result.sdev`` --- standard deviation of the weighted average;
      
      ``result.chi2`` --- :math:`\chi^2` of the weighted average;

      ``result.dof`` --- number of degrees of freedom;

      ``result.Q`` --- *Q* or *p-value* of the weighted average's |chi2|;

      ``result.itn_results`` --- list of the integral estimates 
      from each iteration.

    In this example the final *Q* is 0.42, indicating that the
    :math:`\chi^2` for this average is not particularly unlikely and
    thus the error estimate is most likely reliable.

    **Precision:** The precision of |vegas| estimates is
    determined by ``nitn``, the number of iterations 
    of the |vegas| algorithm,
    and by ``neval``, the maximum number of integrand evaluation
    made per iteration.
    The computing cost is typically proportional to the
    product of ``nitn`` and ``neval``. 
    The number of integrand
    evaluations per iteration
    varies from iteration to iteration,
    here between 486 and 959. Typically |vegas| needs more
    integration points in early iterations, before it has fully
    adapted to the integrand.

    We can increase precision by increasing either ``nitn`` or ``neval``,
    but it is 
    generally far better to increase ``neval``. For example,
    adding the following lines to the code above ::

      result = integ(f, nitn=100, neval=1000)
      print('larger nitn  => %s    Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))
      
      result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=1e4)
      print('larger neval => %s    Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))

    generates the following results:

    .. literalinclude:: eg1b.out

    The total number of integrand evaluations, ``nitn * neval``, is
    about the same in both cases, but increasing ``neval`` is more
    than twice as accurate as increasing ``nitn``. Typically you
    want to use no more than 10 or 20 iterations beyond the
    point where |vegas| has fully adapted. You want some number of
    iterations so that you can verify Gaussian behavior by 
    checking the |chi2| and *Q*, but not too many. 

    It is also generally useful to compare two or more 
    results from values of ``neval`` that differ by a
    significant factor (4--10, say). These should agree within
    errors. If they do not, it could be due to non-Gaussian
    artifacts caused by a small ``neval``. |vegas| 
    estimates have two sources of error. One is the statistical
    error, which is what is quoted by |vegas|. The other is 
    a systematic error due to residual non-Gaussian 
    effects. The systematic error vanishes like
    ``1/neval`` and so becomes negligible compared with 
    the statistical error as ``neval`` increases. 
    The systematic error can bias the Monte Carlo estimate, however, 
    if ``neval`` is insufficiently large. This usually 
    results in a large |chi2| (and small *Q*), but a 
    more reliable check is to compare
    results that use signficantly different values of ``neval``.
    The systematic errors due to non-Gaussian behavior are
    likely negligible if the different estimates agree to
    within the statistical errors. 

    The possibility of systematic biases
    is another reason for increasing ``neval`` 
    rather than ``nitn`` to obtain more precision. 
    Making ``neval`` larger and larger is guaranteed
    to improve the Monte Carlo estimate, as the statistical
    error decreases (at least as fast as ``sqrt(1/neval)``
    and often faster) and the 
    systematic error decreases even more quickly (like
    ``1/neval``). 
    Making ``nitn`` larger and larger, on the other hand,
    is guaranteed eventually to give the wrong
    answer. This is because at some point the statistical error 
    (which falls as ``sqrt(1/nitn)``) will no longer
    mask the systematic error (which is unaffected by ``nitn``). 
    The systematic error for the integral
    above (with ``neval=1000``) is about -0.0008(1), which 
    is negligible compared to the statistical error unless
    ``nitn`` is of order 1500 or larger --- so systematic errors
    aren't a problem with ``nitn=10``.

    **Early Iterations:** Integral estimates from early iterations, 
    before |vegas| has adapted, can be quite 
    crude. With very peaky integrands, these are often far from 
    the correct answer with highly unreliable error estimates. For 
    example, the integral above becomes more 
    difficult if we double the length of each side of the 
    integration volume by redefining ``integ`` as::

      integ = vegas.Integrator([[-2, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0., 2]])

    The code above then gives:

    .. literalinclude:: eg1c.out

    |vegas| misses the peak completely in the first two iterations,
    giving estimates that are completely 
    wrong (by 76 and 123 standard deviations!).
    Some of its samples hit the peak's shoulders, so |vegas| is 
    eventually able to find the peak (by iterations 5--6), but 
    the integrand estimates are wildly non-Gaussian before that
    point. This results in a non-sensical final result, as 
    indicated by the ``Q = 0.00``. 

    It is common practice in using |vegas| to discard 
    estimates from the first several iterations, before the 
    algorithm has adapted, in order to avoid ruining the 
    final result in this way. This is done by replacing the 
    single call to ``integ(f...)`` in the original code 
    with two calls::

      # step 1 -- adapt to f; discard results
      integ(f, nitn=7, neval=1000)

      # step 2 -- integ has adapted to f; keep results
      result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=1000)
      print(result.summary())
      print('result = %s    Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))

    The integrator is trained in the first 
    step, as it adapts to the integrand, and so is more or less
    fully adapted from the start in the second step, which yields:

    .. literalinclude:: eg1d.out

    The final result is now reliable.

    **Other Integrands:** Once ``integ`` has been trained on ``f(x)``, 
    it can be usefully applied
    to other functions with similar structure. For example, adding
    the following at the end of the original code, ::

      def g(x):
          return x[0] * f(x)

      result = integ(g, nitn=10, neval=1000)
      print(result.summary())
      print('result = %s    Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))

    gives the following new output:

    .. literalinclude:: eg1e.out

    Again the grid is almost optimal for ``g(x)`` from the start,
    because ``g(x)`` peaks in the same region as ``f(x)``.
    The exact value for this integral is very close to 0.5.

    Note that |Integrator|\s can be saved in files and reloaded later using
    Python's :mod:`pickle` module: for example, 
    ``pickle.dump(integ, openfile)`` saves integrator ``integ``
    in file ``openfile``, and 
    ``integ = pickle.load(openfile)`` reloads it. The is useful for costly
    integrations that might need to be reanalyzed later since the integrator
    remembers the variable transformations made to minimize errors, and
    so need not be readapted to the integrand when used later.

    **Non-Rectangular Volumes:** |vegas| can integrate over volumes of 
    non-rectangular shape. For example, we can replace integrand ``f(x)`` 
    above 
    by the same Gaussian, but restricted to a 4-sphere of radius 0.2,
    centered on the Gaussian::

        import vegas 
        import math 

        def f_sph(x):
            dx2 = 0 
            for d in range(4): 
                dx2 += (x[d] - 0.5) ** 2
            if dx2 < 0.2 ** 2:
                return math.exp(-dx2 * 100.) * 1115.3539360527281318
            else:
                return 0.0

        integ = vegas.Integrator([[-1, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]])

        integ(f_sph, nitn=10, neval=1000)           # adapt the grid
        result = integ(f_sph, nitn=10, neval=1000)  # estimate the integral
        print(result.summary())
        print('result = %s    Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))
 

    The normalization is adjusted to again make the 
    exact integral equal 1. Integrating as before gives:

    .. literalinclude:: eg1f.out

    It is a good idea to make the actual integration volume as large a 
    fraction as possible of the total volume used by |vegas| ---
    by choosing integration variables properly --- so 
    |vegas| doesn't spend lots of effort on regions where the integrand
    is exactly 0. Also, it can be challenging for |vegas|
    to find the region of 
    non-zero integrand in high dimensions: integrating ``f_sph(x)``
    in 20 dimensions instead of 4, for example, 
    would require ``neval=1e16`` 
    integrand evaluations per iteration to have any chance of 
    finding the region of non-zero integrand, because the volume of 
    the 20-dimensional sphere is a tiny fraction of the total 
    integration volume. The final error in the example above would have
    been cut in half had we used the integration volume
    ``4 * [[0.3, 0.7]]`` instead of ``[[-1, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]]``.

    Note, finally, that integration to infinity is also possible:
    map the relevant variable into a different variable
    of finite range. For example,  an integral over :math:`x\equiv\tan(\theta)`
    from 0 to infinity is easily reexpressed as 
    an integral over :math:`\theta` from 0 to :math:`\pi/2`.

    **Damping:** This result in the previous section 
    can be improved somewhat by slowing down
    |vegas|âs adaptation::

        ...
        integ(f_sph, nitn=10, neval=1000, alpha=0.1)
        result = integ(f_sph, nitn=10, neval=1000, alpha=0.1)  
        ...

    Parameter ``alpha`` controls the speed with which |vegas|
    adapts, with smaller ``alpha``\s giving slower adaptation. 
    Here we reduce ``alpha`` to 0.1, from its default value of 0.5, and get
    the following output:

    .. literalinclude:: eg1g.out

    Notice how the errors fluctuate less from iteration to iteration
    with the smaller ``alpha`` in this case. 
    Persistent, large fluctuations in the size 
    of the per-iteration errors is often a signal that ``alpha`` should
    be reduced. With larger ``alpha``\s, |vegas| can over-react
    to random fluctuations it encounters as it samples the integrand. 

    In general, we want ``alpha`` to be large enough so that |vegas| adapts
    quickly to the integrand, but not so large that it has difficulty 
    holding on to the optimal tuning once it has found it. The best value
    depends upon the integrand. 

    **adapt=False:** Adaptation can be turned off completely
    by setting parameter ``adapt=False``. There are three reasons one
    might do this. The first is if |vegas| is exhibiting the 
    kind of instability discussed in the previous section --- one might
    use the following code, instead of that presented there::

        ...
        integ(f_sph, nitn=10, neval=1000, alpha=0.1)
        result = integ(f_sph, nitn=10, neval=1000, adapt=False)  
        ...

    The second reason is that |vegas| runs slightly faster when it is 
    no longer adapting to the integrand. The difference is not signficant
    for complicated integrands, but is noticable in simpler cases.

    The third reason for turning off adaptation is that |vegas| uses
    unweighted averages, rather than weighted averages, to combine 
    results from different iterations when ``adapt=False``. 
    Unweighted averages are not biased. They have no systematic error
    of the sort discussed above, and so give correct results even 
    for very large numbers of iterations, ``nitn``. 

    The lack of systematic biases is *not* a strong reason for turning
    off adaptation, however, since the biases are 
    usually negligible (see above). Also, again,
    errors tend to fall faster if the number of evaluations per iteration
    ``neval`` is increased rather than the number of iterations. Finally
    in practice it is difficult to know precisely when |vegas| is 
    finished adapting. One often finds (modest) continued improvement after 
    the training step, leading to more accurate final results.

    Training the integrator and then setting ``adapt=False`` for the 
    final results works best if the number of evaluations per iteration
    (``neval``) is the same in both steps. This is because the second
    of |vegas|'s adaptation strategies (adaptive stratified sampling) is
    usually reinitialized when ``neval`` changes, and so is not 
    used at all when ``neval`` is changed at the same time ``adapt=False``
    is set.

Multiple Integrands Simultaneously
-----------------------------------
|vegas| can be used to integrate multiple integrands simultaneously, using
the same integration points for each of the integrands. This is useful 
in situations where the integrands have similar structure, with peaks in
the same locations. There can be  signficant advantages in sampling
different integrands at precisely the same points in |x| space, because
then Monte Carlo estimates for the different integrals are correlated. 
If the integrands are very similar to each other, the correlations can be 
very strong. This leads to greatly reduced errors in ratios or differences
of the resulting integrals as the fluctuations cancel.

Consider a simple example. We want to compute 
the normalization and first two moments of a 
sharply peaked probability distribution:

.. math::
    I_0 &\equiv \int_0^1 d^4x\;
        \mathrm{e}^{- 200 \sum_{d}(x_d-0.5)^2}\\
    I_1 &\equiv \int_0^1 d^4x\; x_0 \; 
        \mathrm{e}^{- 200 \sum_{d}(x_d-0.5)^2} \\
    I_2 &\equiv \int_0^1 d^4x\; x_0^2 \; 
        \mathrm{e}^{- 200 \sum_{d}(x_d-0.5)^2}

From these integrals we determine the mean and width of the distribution
projected onto one of the axes: 

.. math::
    \langle x \rangle &\equiv I_1 / I_0 \\[1ex]
    \sigma_x^2 &\equiv \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle^2 \\
               &= I_2 / I_0 - (I_1 / I_0)^2

This can be done using the following code::

    import vegas
    import math
    import gvar as gv

    def f(x):
        dx2 = 0.0
        for d in range(4):
            dx2 += (x[d] - 0.5) ** 2
        f = math.exp(-200 * dx2)
        return [f, f * x[0], f * x[0] ** 2]

    integ = vegas.Integrator(4 * [[0, 1]])

    # adapt grid 
    training = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=1000)

    # final analysis
    result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=5000)
    print('I[0] =', result[0], '  I[1] =', result[1], '  I[2] =', result[2])
    print('Q = %.2f\n' % result.Q)
    print('<x> =', result[1] / result[0])
    print(
        'sigma_x**2 = <x**2> - <x>**2 =', 
        result[2] / result[0] - (result[1] / result[0]) ** 2
        )
    print('\ncorrelation matrix:\n', gv.evalcorr(result))

The code is very similar to that used in the previous section. The
main difference is that the integrand function and |vegas|
return arrays of results --- in
both cases, one result for each of the three integrals. |vegas| always adapts to 
the first integrand in the array. The ``Q`` value is for all three
of the integrals, taken together. 

The code produces the following output:

.. literalinclude:: eg3a.out

The estimates for the individual integrals are separately accurate to 
about Â±0.1%, 
but the estimate for :math:`\langle x \rangle = I_1/I_0` 
is accurate to Â±0.02%.
This is almost an order
of magnitude (7x) more accurate than we would obtain absent correlations. 
The correlation matrix shows that there is 98% correlation between the
statistical fluctuations in estimates for :math:`I_0` and :math:`I_1`,
and so the bulk of these fluctuations cancel in the ratio. 
The estimate for the variance :math:`\sigma^2_x`
is 45x more accurate than we would 
have obtained had the integrals been evaluated separately. Both estimates
are correct to within the quoted errors. 

The individual results are objects of type :class:`gvar.GVar`, which 
represent Gaussian random variables. Such objects have means 
(``result[i].mean``) and standard deviations (``result[i].sdev``), but 
also can be statistically correlated with other :class:`gvar.GVar`\s.
Such correlations are handled automatically by :mod:`gvar` when 
:class:`gvar.GVar`\s are combined with each other or with numbers in
arithmetical expressions. |vegas| provides a simplified implementation
of ``GVar``\s for use if the :mod:`gvar` module is not installed, but that 
version does *not* handle correlations at all (and, therefore, won't 
allow a statement like ``result[1] / result[0]`` above). To make full
use of this |vegas| feature install the :mod:`gvar` module. It can be 
installed as part of the ``lsqfit`` distribution (e.g., ``pip install lsqfit``)
or by itself (e.g., ``pip install gvar``); source code can be found at 
https://github.com/gplepage/lsqfit.git.


Faster Integrands
-------------------------
The computational cost of a realistic multidimensional integral 
comes mostly from
the cost of evaluating the integrand at the Monte Carlo sample 
points. Integrands written in pure Python are probably fast 
enough for problems where ``neval=1e3`` or ``neval=1e4`` gives
enough precision. Some problems, however, require
hundreds of thousands or millions of function evaluations, or more.

We can significantly reduce the cost of evaluating the integrand
by using |vegas|'s batch mode. For example, replacing ::

    import vegas
    import math

    dim = 4
    norm = 1013.2118364296088 ** (dim / 4.)

    def f_scalar(x):              
        dx2 = 0.0
        for d in range(dim):
            dx2 += (x[d] - 0.5) ** 2
        return math.exp(-100. * dx2) * norm

    integ = vegas.Integrator(dim * [[0, 1]])

    integ(f_scalar, nitn=10, neval=2e5)
    result = integ(f_scalar, nitn=10, neval=2e5)
    print('result = %s   Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))



by ::

    import vegas
    import numpy as np

    class f_batch(vegas.BatchIntegrand):
        def __init__(self, dim):
            self.dim = dim
            self.norm = 1013.2118364296088 ** (dim / 4.)

        def __call__(self, x):
            # evaluate integrand at multiple points simultaneously
            dx2 = 0.0
            for d in range(self.dim):
                dx2 += (x[:, d] - 0.5) ** 2
            return np.exp(-100. * dx2) * self.norm

    f = f_batch(dim=4)
    integ = vegas.Integrator(f.dim * [[0, 1]], nhcube_batch=1000)

    integ(f, nitn=10, neval=2e5)
    result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=2e5)
    print('result = %s   Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))

reduces the cost of the integral by almost an order of magnitude. 
Internally |vegas| processes integration points in batches, where 
parameter ``nhcube_batch`` determines the number of points per
batch (typically 1000s). 
In batch mode, |vegas| presents all of the integration points
from a batch together, in a single array, to the integrand
function, rather than offering them one at a time. Here, for example,
an instance ``f`` of class ``f_batch`` behaves like a function ``f(x)`` of
an array of integration points --- ``x[i, d]`` where ``i=0...``
labels the integration point and ``d=0...`` the direction --- and
returns an array of integrand values corresponding  to these points.

We derive class ``f_batch`` from :class:`vegas.BatchIntegrand` to 
signal to |vegas| that it should present integration points in 
batches to the integrand function. 

An alternative to deriving from :class:`vegas.BatchIntegrand` is 
to apply the :func:`vegas.batchintegrand` decorator to a batch
function for the integrand: e.g., ::

    import vegas
    import numpy as np

    dim = 4
    norm = 1013.2118364296088 ** (dim / 4.)

    @vegas.batchintegrand
    def f(x):
        # evaluate integrand at multiple points simultaneously
        dx2 = 0.0
        for d in range(dim):
            dx2 += (x[:, d] - 0.5) ** 2
        return np.exp(-100. * dx2) * norm

    integ = vegas.Integrator(dim * [[0, 1]], nhcube_batch=1000)

    integ(f, nitn=10, neval=200000)
    result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=200000)
    print('result = %s   Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))



This batch integrand is fast because it is expressed in terms
:mod:`numpy` operators that act on entire arrays. That optimization 
is unnecessary
(and the result is faster) if we write the integrand in Cython, which
is a compiled hybrid of Python and C. The Cython version
of this code is::

    # file: cython_integrand.pyx

    cimport vegas                   # for BatchIntegrand
    from libc.math cimport exp      # use exp() from C library

    import vegas
    import numpy

    cdef class f_cython(vegas.BatchIntegrand):
        cdef double norm
        cdef readonly int dim

        def __init__(self, dim):
            self.dim = dim
            self.norm = 1013.2118364296088 ** (dim / 4.)

        def __call__(self, double[:, ::1] x):
            cdef int i, d
            cdef double dx2
            cdef double[::1] f = numpy.empty(x.shape[0], float)
            for i in range(f.shape[0]):
                dx2 = 0.0
                for d in range(self.dim):
                    dx2 += (x[i, d] - 0.5) ** 2
                f[i] = exp(-100. * dx2) * self.norm
            return f

We put this in a separate file called, say, 
``cython_integrand.pyx``, and rewrite the main code as::

    import pyximport; pyximport.install()

    import vegas
    from cython_integrand import f_cython

    f = f_cython(dim=4)
    integ = vegas.Integrator(f.dim * [[0, 1]], nhcube_batch=1000)

    integ(f, nitn=10, neval=200000)
    result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=200000)
    print('result = %s   Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))

The first line (``import pyximport; ...``) causes the Cython
module ``cython_integrand.pyx`` to be compiled the first time
it is called. The compiled code is stored and used in subsequent 
calls, so compilation occurs only once.

Batch mode is also a good idea for array-valued integrands. 
The code from the previous section could have been written as::

    import vegas
    import gvar as gv
    import numpy as np 

    dim = 4

    @vegas.batchintegrand
    def f(x):
        ans = np.empty((x.shape[0], 3), float)
        dx2 = 0.0
        for d in range(dim):
            dx2 += (x[:, d] - 0.5) ** 2
        ans[:, 0] = np.exp(-200 * dx2)
        ans[:, 1] = x[:, 0] * ans[:, 0]
        ans[:, 2] = x[:, 0] ** 2 * ans[:, 0]
        return ans

    integ = vegas.Integrator(4 * [[0, 1]])
    
    # adapt grid
    training = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=1000)

    # final analysis
    result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=5000)
    print('I[0] =', result[0], '  I[1] =', result[1], '  I[2] =', result[2])
    print('Q = %.2f\n' % result.Q)
    print('<x> =', result[1] / result[0])
    print(
        'sigma_x**2 = <x**2> - <x>**2 =',
        result[2] / result[0] - (result[1] / result[0]) ** 2
        )
    print('\ncorrelation matrix:\n', gv.evalcorr(result))

Note that the batch index (here ``:``) always comes first.

Cython code can also link easily to compiled C or Fortran code, 
so integrands written in these languages can be used as well (and
would be faster than pure Python).

Multiple Processors
---------------------------
|vegas| code normally runs on a single CPU. It is possible 
to distribute the evaluation of the integrand over multiple processors
by using the batch mode described in the previous section. This 
becomes worthwhile when the integrand becomes more expensive to 
evaluate.

|vegas| comes with a decorator, :class:`vegas.MPIintegrand`, that  adapts
batch integrands for multiprocessor use through MPI. It assumes that Python
module :mod:`mpi4py` is installed (and MPI, of course). To illustrate its use
consider an integrand consisting of 1000 narrow Gaussians distributed evenly
along the diagonal of a 4-dimensional unit hypercube. To maximize speed, we
implement the integrand in Cython, putting the result in a file ``ridge.pyx``::

    # file: ridge.pyx
    
    from libc.math cimport exp      # use exp() from C library
    import numpy as np

    def f(double[:, ::1] x): 
        cdef double dx2, x0
        cdef int d, i, j
        cdef int dim=4
        cdef int N=1000
        cdef double[::1] ans = np.zeros(x.shape[0], float)
        for i in range(x.shape[0]):
            for j in range(N):
                x0 = j / (N - 1.)
                dx2 = 0.0
                for d in range(dim):
                    dx2 += (x[i, d] - x0) ** 2
                ans[i] += exp(-100. * dx2)
            ans[i] *= (100. / np.pi) ** 2 / N
        return ans
    
This is a standard batch integrand; it could have been written in Fortran
or C almost as easily, or in Python. The main integration code,
in file ``mpi-integral.py``, is then::

    # file: mpi-integral.py

    import pyximport; pyximport.install()  # compiles ridge.pyx

    import numpy as np
    import vegas
    import ridge

    def main():
        integ = vegas.Integrator(4 * [[0, 1]])
        # convert ridge.f into an MPI integrand
        fparallel = vegas.MPIintegrand(ridge.f)
        # adapt
        integ(fparallel, nitn=10, neval=1e5)
        # final results
        result = integ(fparallel, nitn=10, neval=1e5)
        if fparrallel.rank == 0:
            # result should be approximately 0.851
            print('result = %s    Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

The integrand and main program are identical to what one would use for 
a batch integral except that ``vegas.MPIintegrand(ridge.f)`` is used
in place of ``vegas.batchintegrand(ridge.f)``, and we check the MPI
rank of the process to avoid printing out multiple copies of the result,
after the integration. To run this code on 4 CPUs, we might execute::

    mpirun -np 4 python mpi-integral.py 

This code runs 2.5--3 times faster on 4 CPUs than on a single CPU. 
One might have hoped that 4 CPUs would be 4x faster, but they aren't
quite that fast because of the time needed to transfer integration 
information between the processes on the different CPUs. 
Multiple CPUs are efficient only for costly integrands. 

There are many other ways to implement multiprocessing for |vegas|. 
All methods work with |vegas| in batch mode, and distribute different 
integration points to different CPUs. For example, a class similar
in function to :class:`vegas.MPIintegrand`, but where Python's 
:mod:`multiprocessing` module replaces MPI, is::

    import multiprocessing 
    import numpy as np
    import vegas

    class parallelintegrand(vegas.BatchIntegrand):
        """ Convert (batch) integrand into multiprocessor integrand. 

        Integrand should return a numpy array.
        """
        def __init__(self, fcn, nproc=4):
            " Save integrand; create pool of nproc processes. "
            self.fcn = fcn
            self.nproc = nproc
            self.pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=nproc)
        def __del__(self):
            " Standard cleanup. "
            self.pool.close()
            self.pool.join()
        def __call__(self, x):
            " Divide x into self.nproc chunks, feeding one to each process. "
            nx = x.shape[0] // self.nproc + 1
            # launch evaluation of self.fcn for each chunk, in parallel
            po = self.pool.map_async(
                self.fcn, 
                [x[i*nx : (i+1)*nx] for i in range(self.nproc)],
                1,
                )
            # harvest the results
            results = po.get()
            # convert list of results into a single numpy array
            return np.concatenate(results)

Then ``fparallel = parallelintegrand(f, 4)``, for example, will create a 
new integrand ``fparallel(x)`` that uses 4 CPUs. This particular 
implementation of parallelism is not as efficient as the 
:class:`vegas.MPIintegrand`.

Sums with |vegas|
-------------------
The code in the previous sections is inefficient in the way it
handles the sum over 1000 Gaussians. It is not necessary to include every
term in the sum for every integration point. Rather we can sample the sum,
using |vegas| to do the sampling. The trick is to replace the sum with 
an equivalent integral:

.. math::

    \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(i) = N \int_0^1 dx \; f(\mathrm{floor}(x N))

where :math:`\mathrm{floor}(x)` is the largest 
integer smaller than :math:`x`. The 
resulting integral can then be handed to |vegas|. Using this trick,
the integral in the previous section can be re-cast as a 5-dimensional
integral (again in Cython), ::

    # file: ridge.pyx

    from libc.math cimport exp, floor
    import numpy as np

    def fsum(double[:, ::1] x): 
        cdef double dx2, x0, j
        cdef int d, i
        cdef int dim=4
        cdef int N=1000
        cdef double[::1] ans = np.zeros(x.shape[0], float)
        for i in range(x.shape[0]):
            j = floor(x[i, -1] * N)
            x0 = j / (N - 1.)
            dx2 = 0.0
            for d in range(dim):
                dx2 += (x[i, d] - x0) ** 2
            ans[i] += exp(-100. * dx2)
            # drop 1/N because multiplying by N
            ans[i] *= (100. / np.pi) ** 2 
        return np.asarray(ans)

and the main program becomes::

    import pyximport; pyximport.install()

    import numpy as np
    import vegas
    import ridge

    def main():
        integ = vegas.Integrator(5 * [[0, 1]])
        f = vegas.batchintegrand(ridge.fsum)
        # adapt
        integ(f, nitn=10, neval=5e5)
        # final results
        result = integ(f, nitn=10, neval=5e5)
        # result should be approximately 0.851
        print('result = %s    Q = %.2f' % (result, result.Q))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

This gives about the same precision but is 3x faster (on a laptop in 2014) 
than the code in the previous section.

The same trick can be generalized to sums over multiple indices, including sums
to infinity. |vegas| will provide Monte Carlo estimates of the sums, emphasizing
the more important terms.


|vegas| as a Random Number Generator
-------------------------------------
A |vegas| integrator generates random points in its integration volume from a 
distribution that is optimized for integrals of whatever function it 
was trained on. The integrator 
provides low-level access to the random-point generator
through the iterators :meth:`vegas.Integrator.random` and 
:meth:`vegas.Integrator.random_batch`.

To illustrate, the following code snippet estimates the integral of function
``f(x)`` using integrator ``integ``::

    integral = 0.0
    for x, wgt in integ.random():
        integral += wgt * f(x)

Here ``x[d]`` is a random point in the integration volume and ``wgt`` is the
weight |vegas| assigns to that point in an integration. The iterator generates
integration points and weights corresponding to a single iteration of the
|vegas| algorithm. In practice, we would train ``integ`` on a function whose
shape is similar to that of ``f(x)`` before using it to estimate the integral 
of ``f(x)``. 

It is usually more efficient to generate and use integration points in 
batches. The :meth:`vegas.Integrator.random_batch` iterator does just 
this::

    integral = 0.0
    for x, wgt in integ.random_batch():
        integral += wgt.dot(batch_f(x))

Here ``x[i, d]`` is an array of integration points, ``wgt[i]`` contains the 
corresponding weights, and ``batch_f(x)`` returns an array containing the 
corresponding integrand values.

The random points generated by |vegas| are stratified into hypercubes: |vegas|
uses transformed integration variables to improve its Monte Carlo 
estimates. It further improves those estimates by subdividing the 
integration volume in the transformed variables into a large number of
hypercubes, and doing a Monte Carlo integral in each hypercube separately.
The final result is the sum of the results from all the hypercubes. 
To mimic a full |vegas| integral estimate using the iterators above, we need
to know which points belong to which hypercubes. The following code
shows how this is done::

    integral = 0.0
    variance = 0.0
    for x, wgt, hcube in integ.random_batch(yield_hcube=True):
        wgt_fx = wgt * batch_f(x)
        # iterate over hypercubes: compute variance for each,
        #                          and accumulate for final result
        for i in range(hcube[0], hcube[-1] + 1):
            idx = (hcube == i)          # select array items for h-cube i
            nwf = np.sum(idx)           # number of points in h-cube i
            wf = wgt_fx[idx]        
            sum_wf = np.sum(wf)         # sum of wgt * f(x) for h-cube i
            sum_wf2 = np.sum(wf ** 2)   # sum of (wgt * f(x)) ** 2
            integral += sum_wf
            variance += (sum_wf2 * nwf - sum_wf ** 2) / (nwf - 1.)
    # answer = integral;   standard deviation = variance ** 0.5
    result = gvar.gvar(integral, variance ** 0.5)

Here ``hcube[i]`` identifies the hypercube containing ``x[i, d]``.


Implementation Notes
---------------------
This implementation relies upon Cython for its speed and
numpy for array processing. It also uses matplotlib
for graphics, but graphics is optional. 

|vegas| also uses the :mod:`gvar` module from the :mod:`lsqfit` 
distribution if that package is installed (``pip install lsqfit``
or ``pip install gvar`` for just ``gvar``).
Integration results are returned as objects of type 
:class:`gvar.GVar`, which is a class representing Gaussian
random variables (i.e., something with a mean and standard 
deviation). These objects can be combined with numbers and 
with each other in arbitrary arithmetic expressions to 
get new :class:`gvar.GVar`\s with the correct standard 
deviations, and properly correlated with other 
:class:`gvar.GVar`\s --- that is the tricky part. 

If :mod:`gvar` is not installed, |vegas| uses a limited substitute
that supports arithmetic between :class:`gvar.GVar`\s
and numbers, but not between :class:`gvar.GVar`\s and other
:class:`gvar.GVar`\s. It also supports ``log``, ``sqrt`` 
and ``exp`` of :class:`gvar.GVar`\s, but not trig functions 
--- for these install the ``gvar`` module. Most importantly
|vegas| will not provide correlation information for 
integrals of array-valued integrands unless the :mod:`gvar`
module is available.
