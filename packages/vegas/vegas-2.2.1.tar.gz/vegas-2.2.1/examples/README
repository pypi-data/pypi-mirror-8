These .py files are simple examples showing how to use vegas. 
Use 'make run' to run all of them, and compare the check their 
output against the corresponding .out files.

Some of these examples are discussed in the vegas documentation (which
starts at doc/html/index.html):

    simple.py - From "Basic Integrals" in the Tutorial.

    slow.py - The slowest but easiest way to code an integrand.

    faster.py - A vectorized integrand, for greater speed.

    fastest.py - An integrand coded in Cython, for even greater speed.

    path-integral.py - Quantum mechanics using Feynman's path integral.

    parallel-mpi.py - Parallel processing using MPI

    parallel-pools.py - Parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing module
