0.3.1
-----
 - update ShelveJobStore to take care of specific file systems configurations, because
   sometimes shelve modification time is not updated when "sync()" is called. From now on
   jobs configuration timestamp is stored in shelve and a blocking file lock is used to
   prevent concurrent modifications in it. At least it seems to work on Linux, any feedback
   concerning other OS is still welcome...

 - refactoring to follow last releases of ztfy.skin and ztfy.jqueryui packages
 - redefined interfaces so that tasks scheduling mode (cron-style,
   interval-style...) can be defined on a per-task basis and is not bound
   to the task class; new scheduling modes can also be added via registered
   utilities
 - store tasks execution log in tasks history
 - add an "URL getter" task, which can be used to call a remote "management"
   URL on periodic basis
 - add username/password/realm to ZEO connections
 - modify ZODB packer task to be able to pack another remote database
   instead of only those to which scheduler is defined
 - improved handling of transactions and conflict errors
