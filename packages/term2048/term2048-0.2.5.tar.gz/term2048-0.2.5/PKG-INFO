        Install
        -------
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip install term2048
        
        To upgrade a previous installation, use:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip install -U term2048
        
        Play
        ----
        
        .. code-block::
        
            term2048
        
        Then use arrow keys to move. Since version 0.2.1 VI keys (h,j,k,l) are also
        supported.
        
        Use ``-h`` to check the list of available options, and ``--rules`` for the
        game rules. Press ``<space>`` at any time during the game to pause the game
        (since 0.2.5).
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        Clone this repo, then: ::
        
            [sudo] make deps
            make check
        
        Note: while ``term2048`` should work on Windows, tests are meant to run on
        UNIX-like OSes and ``term2048.keypress``-related tests could fail if run on
        Windows.
