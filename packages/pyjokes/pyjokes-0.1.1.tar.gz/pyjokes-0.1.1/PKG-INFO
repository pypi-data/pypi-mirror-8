        Installation

        Install the `pyjokes` module in pip.
        
        Python 3::
        
            sudo apt-get install python3-pip
            sudo pip3 install pyjokes
        
        or on some systems::
        
            sudo apt-get install python3-pip
            sudo pip-3.2 install pyjokes
        
        Python 2::
        
            sudo apt-get install python-pip
            sudo pip install energenie
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Once installed, simply call `pyjokes` from the command line.
        
        Alternatively pass in the argument `-chuck` for Chuck Norris themed jokes
        
        You can also access the jokes in your own project by importing `pyjokes`. You have access to the `jokes` list, and the `get_local_joke` and `get_chuck_nerd_joke` functions.
