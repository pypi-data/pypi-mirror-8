        One line jokes for programmers (jokes as a service)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install the `pyjokes` module in pip.
        
        Python 3::
        
            sudo apt-get install python3-pip
            sudo pip3 install pyjokes
        
        or on some systems::
        
            sudo apt-get install python3-pip
            sudo pip-3.2 install pyjokes
        
        Python 2::
        
            sudo apt-get install python-pip
            sudo pip install pyjokes
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Once installed, simply call `pyjoke` from the command line.
        
        Alternatively use the `-c` flag to get jokes from a specific category. Options:
        
            -c neutral [default] (neutral geek jokes)
            -c explicit (explicit geek jokes)
            -c chuck (Chuck Norris geek jokes)
            -c all (all jokes)
        
        You can also access the jokes in your own project by importing `pyjokes`. You have access to the `get_joke` function, the `jokes` list, and the joke catgeory lists separately: `geek_neutral`, `geek_explicit`, `chuck_nerdy`.
