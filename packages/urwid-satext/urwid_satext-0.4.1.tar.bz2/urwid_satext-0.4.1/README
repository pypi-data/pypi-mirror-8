A big big thank to the authors/contributors of Urwid (http://excess.org/urwid/), of course.
Nothing would be possible without Python (http://www.python.org/), Gnu and the Free Software Foundation (http://www.gnu.org, http://www.fsf.org/), the Linux Kernel (http://www.kernel.org/), and the coder of the tools I use like Vim (http://www.vim.org/), Mercurial (http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/), or all the KDE stuff (http://www.kde.org/ and of course http://amarok.kde.org/), and also XFCE (http://www.xfce.org), etc. Thanks thanks thanks, thank to everybody in the Free (Libre) chain for making a part of the dream.

If I forgot any credit (and I probably have), please contact me (mail below) to fix it.
