Description: This package provides a simple ``wispr`` command-line tool to authenticate
        against a WISPr server.
        
        WISPr (short for Wireless Internet Service Provider Roaming) is a standard for
        authentication on WiFi hotspots. It is supported by many hotspots, and used by
        all roaming providers.
        
        This client can do three things: check for presence of a WISPr-capable gateway,
        perform a WISPr login and perform a WISPr logoff.
