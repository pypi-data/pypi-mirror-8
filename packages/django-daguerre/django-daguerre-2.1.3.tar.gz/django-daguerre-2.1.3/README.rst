**Django Daguerre** makes it easy to adjust images on-the-fly without
slowing down your templates and without needing to generate everything
ahead of time with a cron job. You don't need to make any changes to
your models; it **Just Works**.

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load daguerre %}
    <img src="{% adjust my_model.image "fill" width=200 height=400 %}" />

    {% adjust_bulk my_queryset "method.image" "fill" width=200 height=400 as adjusted_list %}
    {% for my_model, image in adjusted_list %}
      <img src="{{ image }}" />
    {% endfor %}

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7+, 3.3+
* Pillow 2.3.0+
* Django 1.7+
* Six 1.5.2+

Daguerre *may* work with earlier versions of these packages, but they are not officially supported.

Upgrading from 1.0.X
--------------------

Daguerre 2.1 and up use native Django migrations. If you are
migrating from Daguerre 1.0, and you have manually created
data (for example Areas) that you want to preserve, you
*must* first upgrade to Daguerre 2.0, run the migrations
included in that version, and *then* upgrade to Daguerre
2.1.

This migration path would look as follows::

    $ cd path/to/my/project
    $ pip install django-daguerre==2.0.0
    $ python manage.py migrate daguerre
    $ pip install -U django-daguerre
    $ python manage.py migrate daguerre 0001 --fake
    $ python manage.py migrate daguerre

If you *don't* have any manual data to preserve, and if it
would not adversely affect your site, you can also use the
following migration path::

    $ cd path/to/my/project
    $ python manage.py migrate daguerre zero # Or manually delete the daguerre tables
    $ pip install -U django-daguerre
    $ python manage.py migrate daguerre
    $ python manage.py daguerre clean

Installation
------------

You can install the latest version of Daguerre using ``pip``::

    $ pip install django-daguerre

You can clone the repository yourself at https://github.com/littleweaver/django-daguerre.
