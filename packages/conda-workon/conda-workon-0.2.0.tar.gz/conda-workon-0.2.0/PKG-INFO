        ============
        
        This is a small tool which can be used to activate conda environments.
        It is an alternative to using ``source activate <env>`` and instead
        uses a conda sub-command to spawn a new shell with the environment
        activated.  Deactivating the environment is simply done by exiting
        this sub-shell.  This is very similar to, and based on, the ``pew
        workon`` command from pew_.  One major advantage of this is that it
        does not depend on the shell you use nor does it interact with the
        shell at all.  This means it is not restricted to bash and zsh.
        
        .. _pew: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pew
        
        Activating an environment simply looks like this::
        
           $ conda create -n py26 python=2.6
           ...
           $ conda info -e
           # conda environments:
           #
           py26                     /home/flub/miniconda3/envs/py26
           root                  *  /home/flub/miniconda3
           $ conda workon py26
           Launching subshell in conda environment.  Type "exit" or "Ctr-D" to return.
           (py26) $ conda info -e
           # conda environments:
           #
           py26                  *  /home/flub/miniconda3/envs/py26
           root                     /home/flub/miniconda3
           (py26) $ exit
           $ conda info -e
           # conda environments:
           #
           py26                     /home/flub/miniconda3/envs/py26
           root                  *  /home/flub/miniconda3
        
        Another feature is that it provides an easy throw-away temporary
        environment::
        
           $ conda workon -t python=3.4

           Solving package specifications: .
           Package plan for installation in environment /tmp/tmp7ua0_le9/env:
           ...
           Proceed ([y]/n)? y
           ...
           Launching subshell in conda environment.  Type "exit" or "Ctr-D" to return.
           $ conda info | grep default
             default environment : /tmp/tmp7ua0_le9/env
           $ exit
           $ conda info | grep default
             default environment : /home/flub/miniconda3
           $
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The ``conda-workon`` command needs to be installed in the root conda
        environment.  Currently it can only be installed using setuptools into
        the root environment.  The easiest is to use ``pip``.
        
        Using pip
        ---------
        
        Ensure you have ``pip`` installed in the conda root environment using
        ``conda install pip``.  Then making sure to use this version of pip
        install ``conda-workon`` using::
        
          $ pip install conda-workon
        
        Using conda
        -----------
        
        XXX
        
        
        Configuring the Prompt
        ======================
        
        The ``conda-workon`` command does not interfere with the shell at all,
        it simply starts a new sub-shell with a modified path.  This means
        that by default the prompt of the shell will not indicate which conda
        environment you are using.  However the currently activated conda
        environment is available in the ``CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV`` environment
        variable, which allows you to easily configure your shell as you
        prefer.  A simple example using the fish shell is to include the
        following fragment in the ``fish_prompt`` function::
        
           # Show the conda environment, calculate __fish_prompt_conda only once
           if set -q CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV
               if not set -q __fish_prompt_conda
                   set -g __fish_prompt_conda (set_color --bold -b blue red)$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV"$__fish_prompt_normal "
               end
               echo -n $__fish_prompt_conda
           end
