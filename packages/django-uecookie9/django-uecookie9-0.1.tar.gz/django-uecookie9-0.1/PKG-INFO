Description: ****************
        django-uecookie9
        ****************
        
        Small app that detects if the current user is located in the European Union. If so, a small notification about cookies is displayed. Once notification is closed by the user, it will not appear anymore.
        
        ``uecookie9`` also creates a FlatPage with a Cookie Policy.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        - `pygeoip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygeoip/>`_
        
        - `django.contrib.flatpages <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/flatpages/>`_
        
        Instalation
        ===========
        
        - Install via pip::
        
            pip install django-uecookie9
        
        - Add ``uecookie9`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        
        - Add ``django.core.context_processors.request`` to your ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``::
        
        	from django.conf import settings
        	 TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS + (
        		'django.core.context_processors.request',
        	)
            
        - Override template ``uecookie9/policy.html`` with your actual Cookie Policy.
        
        - Execute the command below (creates a FlatPage ``/cookies/``)::
        
        	python manage.py uecookie9
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Paste the following code in the right place in your template::
        
        	{% load uecookie9 %}{% uecookie9 %}
        
        
        Customization
        =============
        
        By default, notification is wrapped in a fixed div that shows at the bottom of the page. In order to customize it you have to create your own version of template ``uecookie9/message.html``. 
        
        Disclaimer
        ==========
        There is no guarantee that this app is enough to meet UE requirements. Use at your own risk.
