Description: dbghelper
        =========
        
        Little script that allows you to:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import dbg ; dbg.D()
        
        as an alternative to:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()
        
        This will launch winpdb if present (i.e. the GUI session gets set up automatically), and fall back to pdb if not.
