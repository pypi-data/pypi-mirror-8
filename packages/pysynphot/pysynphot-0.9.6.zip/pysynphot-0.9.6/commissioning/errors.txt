This file contains an ongoing log of errors encountered and not
yet resolved by the syn_pysyn tests.


IRAF errors [mystery: errors occur in large runs, but not when  
             the case is run individually]
-------------------------------------------------------
IrafError: Error running IRAF task calcphot
IRAF task terminated abnormally
ERROR (502, "floating point invalid operation")

or 

IrafError: Error running IRAF task countrate
IRAF task terminated abnormally
ERROR (2, "Syntax error in expression")


Missing extinction laws: [#127; solution defined]
-----------------------
NotImplementedError: Sorry, gal2 is not yet implemented
  --> replaced all gal2 by gal1 or gal3
NotImplementedError: Sorry, gal3 is not yet implemented


Wavelength table is not sorted [No workaround identified]:
------------------------------------------------------------------
     This problem is observed when an extinction law is used. The
     computation of the wavelength table for the extinction produces
     the 499.99999x wavelength entry. The problem appeared when the
     pysynphot wavetable was fed to the synphot task (a change made as
     a workaround for the inability of genwave to calculate a
     wavelength table from four parameters, to be fed to calcspec).

     When this workaround is used, sometimes there is an extremely
     small difference between two wavelength elements (say,
     499.9999992343 and 500.0) which are distinguishable in the
     pysynphot double precision table, but which wash out into a
     duplicate wavelength entry (500,500) when it is written out in
     single precision and synphot reads it in.

     This does identify a pysynphot problem: those tables should be
     written out in double precision. But, the problem would still
     occur when synphot read it in. 


Syn/Pysyn produce arrays of different dimensions [no workaround found]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError('Array size mismatch')
--->This is tested for before we try to do the significance test.
If the arrays are not the same shape, this exception is raised.
