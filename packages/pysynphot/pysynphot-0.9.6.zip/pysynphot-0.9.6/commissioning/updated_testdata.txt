The test datasets we're using for this process are not in the
repository, but are instead collected in a tar.gz file in 
/eng/ssb/syn_pysyn. This tar file contains all the datafiles that
are called out by name in the test cases; notably files that are
used by the ETC, such as the earthshine, Zodi, and emission line
files.

On 29 Jan 09, I extended the wavelength range of the earthshine and
Zodi files from 25000 to 27000, to cover the full wavelength range
of the HST instruments. This is a brainless linear extrapolation to
zero at 27000 which is certainly not scientifically correct, but
suffices for the syn_pysyn comparison. 

Real updates to these files must be obtained before the ETC goes into
production using pysynphot.
