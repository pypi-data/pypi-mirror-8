This is a prototype module for manipulating spectra.
It is intended for it to be used for synthetic
photometry, i.e. constructing source spectra and
then passing these spectra through an astronomical
observatory (e.g. HST, JWST...).
 
Install the module the usual way:

python setup.py install

The spectrum manipulation module spectrum.py will work
standalone, whereas the observationmode.py module
is designed to work with the HST synphot database, so
won't be much use unless you also install these files.
(You don't need to install the synphot software; only its 
datafiles.) You can get them from

http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/stsdas/synphot

You must define the environment variable PYSYN_CDBS to point
to the top level directory where you have installed these files.

If you have questions about this module, send mail to
help@stsci.edu and it will get to the appropriate
person.
