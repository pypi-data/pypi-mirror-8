How to perform some of the procedures described in endstage.txt

PENULTIMATE STAGE -- aka "Round 1":

4a. Running a test set
IMPORTANT: must be run under irafdev.
Use runversion.csh to check out, install, and test.
Note hardcoded path names: run tests in
/data/gaudete1/dg2/pysyn_version_compare for simplicity.

Copy the test output to /eng/ssb/syn_pysyn to make generally available


4b-e: Generate subset reports

- upload the test results to the database as a named run
- use tools in test/dbutil
   - python get_subsets.py testrun
       - this produces four files, one each for (subset, extreme,
         countrate, thruput)
   - inst_sort.csh testrun > testrun_summary.log
       - this breaks each of the 4 into 4, one for each instrument
       - summary is printed on stdout
- mail the appropriate 4 files to each instrument team rep
- mail the subset files from all 4 instruments to Danny Lennon so he 
can generate plots

4g: Record accepted failures

- If all are accepted, just use the same list
- If some are not accepted, require the non-accepted ones be removed
- either way, then use 
     python apply_attn.py testrun filename

  for each of the filenames containing accepted failures.
