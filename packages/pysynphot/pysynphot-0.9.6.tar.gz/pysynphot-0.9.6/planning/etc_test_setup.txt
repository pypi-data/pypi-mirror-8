Motes from 12/15/08 meeting on how to configure and proceed with
ETC testing:

A test environment for regression tests only (non-UI tests) is almost
fully defined by:

- a version of the ETC software          }
- a version of the regression tests      } -- all in the extic svn repository
- an update file to the persistent store }
- a version of the pysynphot or synphot software - contained in the
Astrolib or STSDAS repository
- a version of CDBS files - not presently contained in a repository,
but a script to generate a specific CDBS directory could be written &
put into a repository
- a set of directories - not presently contained in a repository, but
a script to generate them could be written & put into a repository


The caveat is that this does not specify versions of the support
software, Java, et cetera. Generally we will get 'whatever is there'
on the machine. These generally change only for major releases.


- When preparation for a round of testing begins, create an
appropriately named branch in the extic directory. Add a description
of the purpose of this round of testing.
- Modify this branch as needed to tailor the test environment; check
in all necessary changes to this branch.
- Conduct testing by checking out & installing to create the environment
- Check in test results to the branch, and any test report.
- When the round of testing is complete, tag the branch for future reference.


The short-term plan:
 - After the branch meeting on Tues 16 Dec, Vicki and Donald will
 create a branch for the first round of testing.
 - Just after New Year's, Vicki will sit down with Donald while he
 creates the test environment including creating the necessary
 directories, and write a script that duplicates the steps - iterating
 as necessary to verify that it all works. Development of the script
 will occur in the branch; once it is well-tested, we'll add it to the trunk. 

 - Circa mid-January, the first round of testing will be run, with:
       17.2.1 version of ETC
       17.2.1 version of RTs modified for pysyn
       Update to persistent store to: use pysyn not syn, use special CDBS
       Pinned version of CDBS
       Release candidate of pysynphot
  - Test results and a final test report will be added to the branch
  - The branch will be tagged. 


Once this first round of testing is completed, and pysynphot is vetted
for use with the ETC:
- ETC trunk development will be switched to use the released pysynphot
- nightly tests will be modified so that we have both:
     - ETC trunk against released pysynphot
     - ETC trunk against pysynphot trunk
- tools will be set up so we can easily run ETC release against pysynphot trunk
