This document describes the functionality provided by the most
commonly used synphot tasks, and identifies the pysynphot builds in
which they will be supported. It also identifies functionality for
which there are at present no plans to provide pysynphot support.

These identifications are tentative, and are subject to revision after
consultation with INS and after a survey is taken of synphot users
both internal to STScI and in the community.

COUNTRATE:
Supported (0.3):
  - compute the total flux (effective stimulation) in counts

Not yet supported:
- can specify exposure time (--; just multiply)
- flux_tot: total flux through band   (--; duplicates calcphot.effstim)
- refwave: a specifically called out flux (0.7)        }
- flux_ref: the flux at the reference wavelength (0.7) } #143



Obsmode: Not yet supported (0.7)
Fills out a partial obsmode with all its possible completions (#144)

Plband-related functionality: (0.7)

- Add a method to SpectralElement.normalize() (#120)

Showfiles: Supported via a method on bandpass (0.4)

Thermback: (0.7) 
now a special newetc task; should be a method on bandpass
or obsmode (#145)

==No need to support:==
Plband, Plspec: use matplotlib/pylab to directly plot spectra & bandpasses
Genwave: use numpy call to create arrays instead
Grafpath: replaced by showfiles

==Utility programs: no plans to support==
Grafcheck: validates graph table as legitimate
Graflist: utility function on graph table
Mkthru: utility for CDBS reference file construction; no plans to support


==Complex tasks: No plans to support unless requested (> 1.0):==
Fitband, fitgrid, fitspec
Imspec
Plratio, pltrans
Simulators
