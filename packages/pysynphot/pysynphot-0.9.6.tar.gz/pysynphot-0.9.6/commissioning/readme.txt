This directory holds the tests and test code that will be used to
commission pysynphot by comparing its results to synphot's results and
determining whether any discrepancies are acceptable. 

Once these tests have all passed, they will be used to generate
additional regression tests, tied to a specific version of the CDBS
files, which will then be incorporated into the pysynphot test suite.
