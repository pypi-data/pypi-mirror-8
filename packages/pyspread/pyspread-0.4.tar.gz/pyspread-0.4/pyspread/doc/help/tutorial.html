<h1>Pyspread Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Running pyspread</h2>

<p>Run pyspread with<br></p>
<pre>
$ pyspread
</pre><br>

<p>Select the Menu File &rarr; New<br>
Enter 200 rows, 10 columns and 5 tables in the pop-up menu.</p>

<p><img alt="image:Tutorial1.png" border="0" src="images/Tutorial1.png"></p>

<p>After clicking OK, you get a new table with the typed-in dimensions.</p>

<h2>Standard cell commands</h2>

<p>Select the top-left cell and type:<br></p>
<pre>
1 + 5 * 2
</pre><br>

<p>The spreadsheet evaluates this Python statement and displays the
result:<br></p>
<pre>
11
</pre><br>

<p>In the cell that is one row below (cell (1, 0, 0)), type<br></p>
<pre>
S
</pre><br>

<p>As we see from the result, S is a known object. In fact, it is the grid
object that we are currently working in.</p>

<h2>Absolute addressing of cells</h2>

<p>To access a cell, we can index the grid. Replace S with<br></p>
<pre>
S[0, 0, 0]
</pre><br>

<p>and the same result as in the top-left cell that has the index (0, 0, 0) is
displayed.<br>
The first index is the row, the second parameter is the column and the third
parameter is the table.<br>
Now replace the expression in the top-left cell by<br></p>
<pre>
1
</pre><br>

<p>Both cells change immediately because all visible cells are updated.</p>

<p><img alt="image:Tutorial2.png" border="0" src="images/Tutorial2.png"></p>

<p>The main grid S can be sliced, too.<br>
Write into cell (3, 0, 0):<br></p>
<pre>
S[:2, 0, 0]
</pre><br>

<p>It now displays [1 1], which is a list of the results of the cells in [:2,
0, 0].</p>

<h2>Relative addressing of cells</h2>

<p>Since cells are addressed via slicing, the cell content behaves similar to
absolute addressing in other spreadsheets. In order to achieve relative
addressing, three magic variables X (row), Y (column) and Z (table) are
used.<br>
These magic variables correspond to the position of the current cell in the
grid.</p>

<p>Change to table 2 by selecting 2 in the iconbar combobox. Type into cell (1,
2, 2):<br></p>
<pre>
[X, Y, Z]
</pre><br>

<p>The result is [1 2 2] as expected. Now copy the cell (Crtl-C) and paste it
into the next lower cell (Ctrl-V). [2 2 2] is displayed. Therefore,
relative addressing is achieved. Note that if cells are called from
within other cells, the innermost cell is considered the current cell and its
position is returned.</p>

<h2>Filling cells</h2>

<p>The easiest method for filling cells with sequences is setting up an initial
value and a function that calculates the next value.<br></p>

<p>Write into cell (1, 1, 2):<br></p>
<pre>
0
</pre>

<p>and into cell (2, 1, 2):<br></p>
<pre>
S[X-1, Y, Z] + 1
</pre>

<p>Then copy cell (2, 1, 2), select the cells (3, 1, 2) to (99, 1, 2) and paste
via &lt;Crtl&gt; + V. Now the cells (1, 1, 2) to (99, 1, 2) contain consecutive
values.<br></p>

<p>Another way to fill cells is to create a string, in which columns are
separated by tabs ans rows by new line characters. Copy such a string with copy
results and paste it into another cell without (!) selecting multiple cells
fills cells with the selected cell in the upper left corner.<br></p>

<p>Note: The old "spread" method has been removed because of cell update
problems.<br></p>

<h2>Named cells</h2>

<p>Cells can be named by preceding the Python expression with "&lt;name&gt; =".
Type into cell (2, 4, 2):<br></p>
<pre>
a = 3 * 5
</pre><br>

<p>and in cell (3, 4, 2):<br></p>
<pre>
a ** 2
</pre><br>

<p>The results 15 and 225 appear. a is globally available in all cells.</p>

<h2>External modules</h2>

<p>External modules can be imported into pyspread. Therefore, powerful types
and manipulation methods are available.<br>
Type into cell (5, 2, 2):<br></p>
<pre>
gmpy = __import__("fractions")
</pre><br>

<p>&lt;module 'fractions' etc. is displayed. Now we redefine the rational
number object in cell (6, 2, 2) in order to reduce typing and type in two
rationals in the next two cells:<br></p>
<pre>
q = fractions.fraction("1/37")
</pre><br>
<pre>
1/37
</pre><br>
<pre>
229 / 13
</pre><br>

<p>In the next cell (9, 2, 2) type:<br></p>
<pre>
S[X - 2, Y, Z] + S[X - 1, Y, Z]
</pre><br>

<p>The result is 8486/481.</p>

<h2>Working with cells</h2>

<p>Summing up cells:<br>
Assuming that the cells (1,0,0) - (15, 0, 0) contain the values 1 to 15,
entering into cell (16,0,0):</p>
<pre>
sum(S[1:16,0,0])<br>
</pre>

<p>yields 120 as expected.</p>

<p>However, if there are more columns (or tables) to sum up, each row is summed
up individually. Therefore, copying the data to column 2 and changing the cell
(16,0,0) to</p>
<pre>
sum(S[1:16,0:2,0])<br>
</pre>

<p>yields [120 120].</p>

<p>If everything shall be summed, the numpy.sum function has to be used:</p>
<pre>
numpy.sum(S[1:16,0:2,0])<br>
</pre>

<p>yields 240.</p>

<h2>Plotting</h2>Pyspread renders a plot in any cell that returns a matplotlib
figure. Merging the cell with other cells can increase plot size. In order to
make generating plots easier, a chart dialog has been added to the Macros menu.
This chart dialog generates a formula for the current cell. This formula uses a
pyspread specific function that returns a matplotlib figure. You can use the
object S inside the chart dialog window.<br>

<p>Type into cell (1, 0, 3):<br></p>
<pre>
numpy.arange(0.0, 10.0, 0.1)<br><br>
</pre>

<p>Create the y value list in cell (2, 0, 3):<br></p>
<pre>
[math.sin(x) for x in S[1, 0, 3]]
</pre><br>
Now open the chart dialog window and enter<br>
<pre>
S[1, 0, 3]<br><br>
</pre>for x values and<br>
<pre>
S[2, 0, 3]<br><br>
</pre>for y values. A figure displays inside the dialog. Press Ok and the
figure is displayed inside the current cell. It scales with cell size.<br>
