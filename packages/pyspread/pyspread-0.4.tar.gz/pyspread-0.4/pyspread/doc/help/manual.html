    <h2>What is pyspread about?</h2>
    <p>Not too long ago, I wrote a small decision support system for
      engineers in a spreadsheet application that we all know too well.
      Because the calculations should be transparent, everything was
      realized with the in-cell functions. It works now. However, the
      length and complexity of the cell commands keep the application
      pretty opaque.<br>
      Therefore, I looked for a spreadsheet with more powerful functions
      and data structures that are accessible inside each cell.
      Something like Python that empowers you to do things quickly. And
      yes, it should be free and it should run on Linux as well as on
      Windows. I looked around and found nothing that suited me.
      Therefore, I started pyspread. </p>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Each cell accepts any input that works in a Python command
        line. </li>
      <li> The inputs are parsed and evaluated by Python's eval command.
      </li>
      <li> The result objects are accessible via a 3D numpy object
        array. </li>
      <li> String representations of the result objects are displayed in
        the cells. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Each cell returns a Python object. This object can be
        anything including arrays and third party library objects. </li>
      <li> Generator expressions can be used efficiently for data
        manipulation. </li>
      <li> Efficient numpy slicing is used. </li>
      <li> numpy methods are accessible for the data. </li>
    </ul>
