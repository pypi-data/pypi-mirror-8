MapIt is a service that maps UK postcodes and geographical points to
administrative areas. It&rsquo;s useful for anyone who has a postcode or
co-ordinates of a point in the UK, and needs to find out what region,
constituency, or council it lies within. It&rsquo;s also great for looking up
the shapes of all those boundaries.

MapIt is a service that maps geographical points to administrative areas.
This edition is based on source data from the totally amazing
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> project,
so add your boundaries there if they&rsquo;re missing.
If you&rsquo;re in the UK our <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/">MapIt UK</a>
with open Ordnance Survey data will probably be more useful.

            <h3>About MapIt</h3>

            <p>MapIt was written back in 2003 as a postcode lookup to power the
            original <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> sites
            such as <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a>. Over
            time it gained features such as point lookup (for
            <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/">FixMyStreet</a>), and when
            Ordnance Survey data became freely available in 2010, it was
            rewritten and made public for the whole UK.
