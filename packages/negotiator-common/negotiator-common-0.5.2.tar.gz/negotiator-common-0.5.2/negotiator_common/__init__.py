``negotiator_common`` - Common shared functionality
===================================================

This Python module contains the functionality that is shared between the
negotiator-host_ and negotiator-guest_ packages. By moving all of the shared
functionality to a separate Python package and using Python package
dependencies to pull in the negotiator-common_ package we stimulate code reuse
while avoiding code duplication.
