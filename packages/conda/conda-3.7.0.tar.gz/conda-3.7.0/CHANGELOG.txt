  * be more careful in conda config about keys that are the wrong type
  * don't expect directories starting with conda- to be commands
  * no longer recommend to run conda init after pip installing conda. A pip
    installed conda will now work without being initialized to create and
    manage other environments
  * the rm function on Windows now works around access denied errors
  * fix channel urls now showing with conda list with show_channel_urls set to
    true

-------------------
  * skip packages that can't be found with update --all
  * add --use-local to search and remove
  * allow --use-local to be used along with -c (--channels) and
    --override-channels. --override-channels now requires either -c or
    --use-local
  * allow paths in has_prefix to be quoted, to allow for spaces in paths on
    Windows
  * retain Unix style path separators for prefixes in has_prefix on
    Windows (if the placeholder path uses /, replace it with a path that uses
    /, not \)
  * fix bug in --use-local due to API changes in conda-build
  * include user site directories in conda info -s
  * make binary has_prefix replacement work with spaces after the prefix
  * make binary has_prefix replacement replace multiple occurrences of the
    placeholder in the same null-terminated string
  * don't show packages from other platforms as installed or cached in conda
    search
  * be more careful about not warning about conda itself in pscheck
  * Use a progress bar for the unsatisfiable packages hint generation
  * Don't use TemporaryFile in try_write, as it is too slow when it fails
  * Ignore InsecureRequestWarning when ssl_verify is False
  * conda remove removes features tracked by removed packages in
    track_features


2014-08-20   3.6.2:
-------------------
  * add --use-index-cache to conda remove
  * fix a bug where features (like mkl) would be selected incorrectly
  * use concurrent.future.ThreadPool to fetch package metadata asynchronously
    in Python 3.
  * do the retries in rm_rf on every platform
  * use a higher cutoff for package name misspellings
  * allow changing default channels in "system" .condarc

-------------------
  * add retries to download in fetch module
  * improved error messages for missing packages
  * more robust rm_rf on Windows

  * correctly check if a package can be hard-linked if it isn't extracted yet
  * change how the package plan is printed to better show what is new,
    updated, and downgraded
  * use suggest_normalized_version in the resolve module. Now versions like
    1.0alpha that are not directly recognized by verlib's NormalizedVersion
    are supported better
  * conda run command, to run apps and commands from packages
  * more complete --json API. Every conda command should fully support --json
    output now.

  * update optional psutil dependency was updated to psutil 2.0 or higher


2014-05-15   3.5.0:
-------------------

    conda.
  * add ability to only allow system-wise specified channels
  * hide binstar from output of conda info


2014-05-05   3.4.3:

  * fixed empty history file causing crash, issue #644
  * remove timezone information from history file, fixes issue #651

    local package cache is --unknown
  * add --alt-hint as a method to get an alternate form of a hint for
    unsatisfiable packages
  * add conda package --ls-files to list files in a package
  * add ability to pin specs in an environment. To pin a spec, add a file
    called pinned to the environment's conda-meta directory with the specs to
    pin. Pinned specs are always kept installed, unless the --no-pin flag is
    used.
  * fix keyboard interrupting of external commands. Now keyboard interupting
    conda build correctly removes the lock file
  * add no_link ability to conda, see issue #678


2014-04-07   3.4.1:
-------------------
  * always use a pkgs cache directory associated with an envs directory, even
    when using -p option with an arbitrary a prefix which is not inside an
    envs dir
  * add setting of PYTHONHOME to conda info --system
  * skip packages with bad metadata


2014-04-02   3.4.0:
-------------------
  * added revision history to each environment:
      - conda list --revisions
      - conda install --revision
      - log is stored in conda-meta/history
  * allow parsing pip-style requirement files with --file option and in command
    line arguments, e.g. conda install 'numpy>=1.7', issue #624
  * fix error message for --file option when file does not exist
  * allow DEFAULTS in CONDA_ENVS_PATH, which expands to the defaults settings,
    including the condarc file

    specifically requested (i.e., that feature is already enabled in that
    environment)
  * add ability to show channel URLs when displaying what is going to be
    downloaded by setting "show_channel_urls: True" in condarc
  * fix the --quiet option
  * skip packages that have dependencies that can't be found

-------------------
  * Fix setting of PS1 in activate.
  * Add conda update --all.
  * Allow setting CONDARC=' ' to use no condarc.
  * Add conda clean --packages.
  * Don't include bin/conda, bin/activate, or bin/deactivate in conda
    package.


2014-03-18   3.3.0:
-------------------
  * allow new package specification, i.e. ==, >=, >, <=, <, != separated
    by ',' for example: >=2.3,<3.0
  * add ability to disable self update of conda, by setting
    "self_update: False" in .condarc
  * Try installing packages using the old way of just installing the maximum
    versions of things first. This provides a major speedup of solving the
    package specifications in the cases where this scheme works.
  * Don't include python=3.3 in the specs automatically for the Python 3
    version of conda.  This allows you to do "conda create -n env package" for
    a package that only has a Python 2 version without specifying
    "python=2". This change has no effect in Python 2.
  * Automatically put symlinks to conda, activate, and deactivate in each
    environment on Unix.
  * On Unix, activate and deactivate now remove the root environment from the
    PATH. This should prevent "bleed through" issues with commands not
    installed in the activated environment but that are installed in the root
    environment. If you have "setup.py develop" installed conda on Unix, you
    should run this command again, as the activate and deactivate scripts have
    changed.
  * Begin work to support Python 3.4.
  * Fix a bug in version comparison
  * Fix usage of sys.stdout and sys.stderr in environments like pythonw on
    Windows where they are nonstandard file descriptors.

-------------------
  * print dots to the screen for progress
  * move logic functions from resolve to logic module


2014-03-07   3.2.0a1:
---------------------
  * conda now uses pseudo-boolean constraints in the SAT solver. This allows
    it to search for all versions at once, rather than only the latest (issue
    #491).
  * Conda contains a brand new logic submodule for converting pseudo-boolean
    constraints into SAT clauses.


2014-03-07   3.1.1:
-------------------
  * check if directory exists, fixed issue #591


2014-03-07   3.1.0:
-------------------
  * local packages in cache are now added to the index, this may be disabled
    by using the --known option, which only makes conda use index metadata
    from the known remote channels
  * add --use-index-cache option to enable using cache of channel index files
  * fix ownership of files when installing as root on Linux
  * conda search: add '.' symbol for extracted (cached) packages

2014-02-06   3.0.3:
-------------------
  * improve the speed of clean --lock
  * some fixes to conda config
  * more tests added
  * choose the first solution rather than the last when there are more than
    one, since this is more likely to be the one you want.


2014-02-03   3.0.2:
-------------------
  * fix detection of prefix being writable


2014-01-31   3.0.1:
-------------------
  * bug: not having track_features in condarc now uses default again
  * improved test suite
  * remove numpy version being treated special in plan module
  * if the post-link.(bat|sh) fails, don't treat it as though it installed,
    i.e. it is not added to conda-meta
  * fix activate if CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV is invalid
  * fix conda config --get to work with list keys again
  * print the total download size
  * fix a bug that was preventing conda from working in Python 3
  * add ability to run pre-link script, issue #548


2014-01-24   3.0.0:
-------------------
  * removed build, convert, index, and skeleton commands, which are now
    part of the conda-build project: https://github.com/conda/conda-build
  * limited pip integration to `conda list`, that means
    `conda install` no longer calls `pip install` # !!!
  * add ability to call sub-commands named 'conda-x'
  * The -c flag to conda search is now shorthand for --channel, not
    --canonical (this is to be consistent with other conda commands)
  * allow changing location of .condarc file using the CONDARC environment
    variable
  * conda search now shows the channel that the package comes from
  * conda search has a new --platform flag for searching for packages in other
    platforms.
  * remove condarc warnings: issue #526#issuecomment-33195012


2014-01-17   2.3.1:
-------------------
  * add ability create info/no_softlink
  * add conda convert command to convert non-platform-dependent packages from
    one platform to another (experimental)
  * unify create, install, and update code. This adds many features to create
    and update that were previously only available to install. A backwards
    incompatible change is that conda create -f now means --force, not
    --file.


2014-01-16   2.3.0:
-------------------
  * automatically prepend http://conda.binstar.org/ (or the value of
    channel_alias in the .condarc file) to channels whenever the
    channel is not a URL or the word 'defaults or 'system'
  * recipes made with the skeleton pypi command will use setuptools instead of
    distribute

    see issue #427, thanks peter1000


2013-12-10   2.2.4:
-------------------
  * add support for execution with the -m switch (issue #398), i.e. you
    can execute conda also as: python -m conda

    .<name>-post-link.sh and .<name>-pre-unlink.sh


2013-11-15   2.2.1:
-------------------
  * minor fixes related to make conda pip installable

        will create a recipe (stored in <root>/conda-recipes) from pypi
        then build a conda package (and install it)
      * pip list and pip install only happen if pip is installed
  * enhance the locking mechanism so that conda can call itself in the same
    process.


2013-11-04   2.0.4:
-------------------
  * ensure lowercase name when generating package info, fixed issue #329
  * on Windows, handle the .nonadmin files
