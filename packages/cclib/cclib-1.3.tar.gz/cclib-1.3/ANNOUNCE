On behalf of the cclib development team, we are pleased to announce the release of cclib 1.3, which is now available for download from http://cclib.github.io. This version includes three new parsers (for NWchem, Psi and QChem), as well as a number of bug fixes and improvements (see below).

cclib is an open source library, written in Python, for parsing and interpreting the results of computational chemistry packages. It currently parses output files from ADF, Firefly, GAMESS (US), GAMESS-UK, Gaussian, Jaguar, Molpro, NWChem, ORCA, Psi and QChem.

Among other data, cclib extracts:

    * coordinates and energies
    * information about geometry optimization
    * atomic orbital information
    * molecular orbital information
    * information on vibrational modes
    * the results of a TD-DFT calculation
    * charges and mutlipole moments

(For a complete list see http://cclib.github.io/data.html).

cclib also provides some calculation methods for interpreting the electronic properties of molecules using analyses such as:

    * Mulliken and Lowdin population analyses
    * Overlap population analysis
    * Calculation of Mayer's bond orders. 

(For a complete list see http://cclib.github.io/methods.html).
