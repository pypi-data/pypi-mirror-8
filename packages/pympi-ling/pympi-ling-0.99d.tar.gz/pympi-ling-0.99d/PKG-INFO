Description: Documentation can be found on: http://dopefishh.github.io/pympi/
        
        Pympi is a package that allows you to interact with Elan[1] files and
        TextGrid[2] files. You can create, edit and convert both formats into
        eachother. It also includes a gaps and overlaps algorithm to calculate the
        gaps, overlaps and pauses between annotations conform Heldner and Edlund's
        method[3].
        
        The Praat module is already on version 1.0, the Elan module not. From version
        1.0 on the modules will retain backwards compatibility.
        
        The development version can be found on github[4].
