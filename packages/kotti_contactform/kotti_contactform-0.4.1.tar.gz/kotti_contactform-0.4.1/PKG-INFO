        Setup
        =====
        
        To enable the extension in your Kotti site, activate the configurator:
        
            kotti.configurators =
                kotti_settings.kotti_configure
                kotti_contactform.kotti_configure
        
        Please note that ``kotti_contactform >= 0.4`` depends on kotti_settings_,
        so you have to list it in your ``kotti.configurators`` too.
        
        ``kotti_contactform`` uses ``pyramid_mailer`` for sending mails and
        tries to use your mailserver at localhost:25. If these defaults don't
        fit your needs, you have to configure ``pyramid_mailer``:
        http://packages.python.org/pyramid_mailer/
        
        If you add kotti_contactform to an existing Kotti site (i.e. a Kotti
        installation with an already existing database), you have to
        initialize the database migration with Kotti's ``kotti-migrate``
        console skript: ``kotti-migrate
        stamp_head --scripts=kotti_contactform:alembic``.
        
        Database upgrade
        ================
        
        If you upgrade to version 0.1.1 or 0.4 you have to migrate your
        database. The migration is performed with `alembic`_ and Kotti's
        console script ``kotti-migrate``. To migrate, run ``kotti-migrate
        upgrade_all --scripts=kotti_contactform:alembic``.
        
        For integration of alembic in your environment please refer to the
        `alembic documentation`_. If you have problems with the upgrade,
        please create a new issue in the `tracker`_.
        
        Settings
        ========
        
        Point your browser to http://your.domain/@@settings to get to the settings page
        or use the submenupoint of 'Site Setup'.
        
        You can specify a default sender address that will be used as the default for newly created contact forms.
        
        You can also enable the use of a captcha in your contact forms.
        For the captcha the reCAPATCHA_ service is used.
        You have to sign up to get a key pair in order to use the service on your site.
        In the settings you have to save your public and your private key.
        Have a look at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/ to sign up and get your keys.
