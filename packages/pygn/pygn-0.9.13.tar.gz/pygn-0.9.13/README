It is intended to be a full SMTP/NNTP rfc compliant gateway
with whitelist manager.

You will probably have to install a mail-transport-agent and/or
news-transport-system package to manage SMTP/NNTP traffic.

MTA is needed for mail2news service, since mail have to be
processed on a box where pyg is installed. You can use a remote
smtpserver for news2mail.

News system is useful but not needed, since you can send articles to a
remote SMTP server (ie: moderated NG) where is installed pyg, otherwise you
will need it.

It refers to rfc 822 (mail) and 850 (news).
