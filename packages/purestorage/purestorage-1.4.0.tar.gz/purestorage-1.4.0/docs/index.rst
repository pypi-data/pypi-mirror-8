Overview
--------

The **Pure Storage FlashArray REST Client** is a python module that simplifies
integration with the Pure Storage FlashArray REST interface.

It wraps REST calls with simple APIs and abstracts the HTTP request and
response handling. For specifics on API arguments, consult the REST API
guide for the Purity release currently running on the target array.

This documentation should be supplemental and attempts to explain installation,
basic usage, and provides a glossary of the exposed APIs.
