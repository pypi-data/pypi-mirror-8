Examples
--------

To make sure your cache generation scripts don't race, use the `Lock` class:

>>> import portalocker
>>> with portalocker.Lock('somefile', timeout=1) as fh:
    print >>fh, 'writing some stuff to my cache...'

To lock a file exclusively, use the `lock` method:

>>> import portalocker
>>> file = open('somefile', 'r+')
>>> portalocker.lock(file, portalocker.LOCK_EX)
>>> file.seek(12)
>>> file.write('foo')
>>> file.close()

There is no explicit need to unlock the file as it is automatically unlocked
after `file.close()`. If you still feel the need to manually unlock a file
than you can do it like this:

>>> portalocker.unlock(file)

Do note that your data might still be in a buffer so it is possible that your
data is not available until you `flush()` or `close()`.
