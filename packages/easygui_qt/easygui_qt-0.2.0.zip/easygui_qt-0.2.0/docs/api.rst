==================
EasyGUI_Qt API
==================

*Note:* if you are reading this documentation on "ReadTheDocs" site,
it will not appear quite as it should.

Most functions in EasyGUI_Qt are wrapped by decorators so that a
PyQt application can
automatically be started.  As a result, only a generic signature for
each function appears when viewed on ReadTheDocs;
this is due to a limitation of ReadTheDocs
since the signature **is** available when using Python's help() system.
However, by clicking on "source", it is possible to view the signature
if needed.
