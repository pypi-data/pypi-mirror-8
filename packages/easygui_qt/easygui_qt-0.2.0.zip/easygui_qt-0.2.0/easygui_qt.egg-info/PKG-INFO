        *Inspired by EasyGUI, designed for PyQt*

        EasyGUI_Qt is a module for simple and easy GUI programming in Python.
        
        EasyGUI_Qt was inspired by EasyGUI created by Stephen Ferg and
        is based on Tkinter.  By contrast, EasyGUI_Qt is based on PyQt
        which is not included in the standard Python distribution - but is
        included in some other distributions like Continuum Analytics' Anaconda.

        Features
        --------
        
        * EasyGUI_Qt is NOT event-driven: all GUI interactions are invoked
          by simple function calls.
        
        * EasyGui_Qt provides an easy-to-use interface for simple GUI interaction with a
          user.  For example, instead of using a print() function to display a message,
          show_message() is used which pops a message window; similarly, instead
          of Python's input(), get_string() creates a window in which a user
          can enter the required information.
