EasyGUI_Qt is a module for simple and easy GUI programming in Python.

EasyGUI_Qt was inspired by EasyGUI created by Stephen Ferg and
is based on Tkinter.  By contrast, EasyGUI_Qt is based on PyQt
which is not included in the standard Python distribution - but is
included in some other distributions like Continuum Analytics' Anaconda.

Features
--------

* EasyGUI_Qt is NOT event-driven: all GUI interactions are invoked
  by simple function calls.

* EasyGui_Qt provides an easy-to-use interface for simple GUI interaction with a
  user.  For example, instead of using a print() function to display a message,
  show_message() is used which pops a message window; similarly, instead
  of Python's input(), get_string() creates a window in which a user
  can enter the required information.
