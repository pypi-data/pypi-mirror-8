## iso639.txt

`iso639.txt` is an incomplete mapping between ISO language codes and English
language names.

It was retrieved from
http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/iso-languagecodes.txt, a file that is
part of the GeoNames geographical database.  GeoNames is released under a
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license, and is hosted at http://geonames.org.

Some parenthetical clarifications were removed: for example, we've removed "
(macrolanguage)" from the ends of a few language names, renamed "Modern Greek
(1453-)" to "Greek", and removed date ranges from language names that were
already unique.

## zh_frames.json
