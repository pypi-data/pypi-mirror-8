Description: ====================================
        Notice: This library is now sunset
        ====================================
        
        As of 1/5/15, this library is sunset and will no longer receive updates for new
        versions of supported APIs or bug fixes. Once all supported APIs are no longer
        compatible with this library, it will be removed from GitHub and PyPI.
        
        A newer library named googleads is available that supports Python 2.7 and Python
        3.3+. You can read more about it here:

        Installation
        ============
        
        You have two options for installing the Ads Python Client Libraries:
        
        * Install with a tool such as pip::
        
          $ sudo pip install adspygoogle
          $ --allow-external PyXML
          $ --allow-unverified PyXML
          $ --allow-external ElementTree
          $ --allow-unverified ElementTree
          $ --allow-external cElementTree
          $ --allow-unverified cElementTree
        
        * Install manually after downloading and extracting the tarball::
        
          $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        Examples and Configuration Scripts
        ==================================
        
        This package only provides the core components necessary to use the client
        libraries. If you would like to obtain example code for any of the included
        client libraries, you can find it on our
        `downloads page <https://github.com/googleads/googleads-python-legacy-lib/releases>`_.
        
        Known Issues
        ============
        
        * Due to changes to PyPI's installation process, using 'pip install' to install
          the library currently requires a number of 'allow-external' and
          'allow-unverified' flags for the external dependencies of PyXML, ElementTree,
          and cElementTree. If you're using a version of Python greater than 2.5 and
          would prefer not to install PyXML or cElementTree from external sources, then
          follow the steps below to install via the tarball without those dependencies
          (cElementTree is installed already as a default library in > Python 2.5).
          Alternatively, if you would prefer to download these libraries to install
          yourself, they can be downloaded at these locations:
        
            - `ElementTree <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elementtree/>`_
            - `cElementTree <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cElementTree>`_
            - `PyXML <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyXML/0.8.4>`_
        
        * The installation of PyXML and cElementTree will fail on Ubuntu 13.04. If you
          are trying to install adspygoogle on Ubuntu 13.04, you should avoid installing
          these dependencies. If you need to use either of these dependencies, there is
          a work-around that can be found in
          `this bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python2.7/+bug/1238244/>`_.
          Another alternative is to install manually and exclude these dependencies. To
          do so, first download and extract the tarball below. In the root directory,
          run the following command::
        
          $ sudo python setup.py install --no_PyXML --no_cElementTree
