Installation
============

You have two options for installing the Ads Python Client Libraries:

* Install with a tool such as pip::

  $ sudo pip install adspygoogle
  $ --allow-external PyXML
  $ --allow-unverified PyXML
  $ --allow-external ElementTree
  $ --allow-unverified ElementTree
  $ --allow-external cElementTree
  $ --allow-unverified cElementTree

* Install manually after downloading and extracting the tarball::

  $ sudo python setup.py install

Examples and Configuration Scripts
==================================

This package only provides the core components necessary to use the client
libraries. If you would like to obtain example code for any of the included
client libraries, you can find it on our
`downloads page <https://github.com/googleads/googleads-python-legacy-lib/releases>`_.

Known Issues
============

* Due to changes to PyPI's installation process, using 'pip install' to install
  the library currently requires a number of 'allow-external' and
  'allow-unverified' flags for the external dependencies of PyXML, ElementTree,
  and cElementTree. If you're using a version of Python greater than 2.5 and
  would prefer not to install PyXML or cElementTree from external sources, then
  follow the steps below to install via the tarball without those dependencies
  (cElementTree is installed already as a default library in > Python 2.5).
  Alternatively, if you would prefer to download these libraries to install
  yourself, they can be downloaded at these locations:

    - `ElementTree <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elementtree/>`_
    - `cElementTree <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cElementTree>`_
    - `PyXML <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyXML/0.8.4>`_

* The installation of PyXML and cElementTree will fail on Ubuntu 13.04. If you
  are trying to install adspygoogle on Ubuntu 13.04, you should avoid installing
  these dependencies. If you need to use either of these dependencies, there is
  a work-around that can be found in
  `this bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python2.7/+bug/1238244/>`_.
  Another alternative is to install manually and exclude these dependencies. To
  do so, first download and extract the tarball below. In the root directory,
  run the following command::

  $ sudo python setup.py install --no_PyXML --no_cElementTree
