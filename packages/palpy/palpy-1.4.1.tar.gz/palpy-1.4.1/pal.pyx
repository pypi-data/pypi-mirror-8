Notes
-----
- Natural units are used throughout.  HA, DEC, PHI, AZ, EL
  and ZD are in radians.  The velocities and accelerations
  assume constant declination and constant rate of change of
  hour angle (as for tracking a star);  the units of AZD, ELD
  and PAD are radians per radian of HA, while the units of AZDD,
  ELDD and PADD are radians per radian of HA squared.  To
  convert into practical degree- and second-based units:

    angles * 360/2pi -> degrees
    velocities * (2pi/86400)*(360/2pi) -> degree/sec
    accelerations * ((2pi/86400)**2)*(360/2pi) -> degree/sec/sec

  Note that the seconds here are sidereal rather than SI.  One
  sidereal second is about 0.99727 SI seconds.

  The velocity and acceleration factors assume the sidereal
  tracking case.  Their respective numerical values are (exactly)
  1/240 and (approximately) 1/3300236.9.

- Azimuth is returned in the range 0-2pi;  north is zero,
  and east is +pi/2.  Elevation and parallactic angle are
  returned in the range +/-pi.  Parallactic angle is +ve for
  a star west of the meridian and is the angle NP-star-zenith.

- The latitude is geodetic as opposed to geocentric.  The
  hour angle and declination are topocentric.  Refraction and
  deficiencies in the telescope mounting are ignored.  The
  purpose of the routine is to give the general form of the
  quantities.  The details of a real telescope could profoundly
  change the results, especially close to the zenith.

- No range checking of arguments is carried out.

- In applications which involve many such calculations, rather
  than calling the present routine it will be more efficient to
  use inline code, having previously computed fixed terms such
  as sine and cosine of latitude, and (for tracking a star)
  sine and cosine of declination.

Notes
-----
- This routine returns zenith distance rather than elevation
  in order to reflect the fact that no allowance is made for
  depression of the horizon.

- The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
  refraction.  Providing the meteorological parameters are
  known accurately and there are no gross local effects, the
  predicted apparent RA,Dec should be within about 0.1 arcsec
  for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees.  Even at a
  topocentric zenith distance of 90 degrees, the accuracy in
  elevation should be better than 1 arcmin;  useful results
  are available for a further 3 degrees, beyond which the
  palRefro routine returns a fixed value of the refraction.
  The complementary routines palAop (or palAopqk) and palOap
  (or palOapqk) are self-consistent to better than 1 micro-
  arcsecond all over the celestial sphere.

- It is advisable to take great care with units, as even
  unlikely values of the input parameters are accepted and
  processed in accordance with the models used.

- "Apparent" place means the geocentric apparent right ascension
  and declination, which is obtained from a catalogue mean place
  by allowing for space motion, parallax, precession, nutation,
  annual aberration, and the Sun's gravitational lens effect.  For
  star positions in the FK5 system (i.e. J2000), these effects can
  be applied by means of the palMap etc routines.  Starting from
  other mean place systems, additional transformations will be
  needed;  for example, FK4 (i.e. B1950) mean places would first
  have to be converted to FK5, which can be done with the
  palFk425 etc routines.

- "Observed" Az,El means the position that would be seen by a
  perfect theodolite located at the observer.  This is obtained
  from the geocentric apparent RA,Dec by allowing for Earth
  orientation and diurnal aberration, rotating from equator
  to horizon coordinates, and then adjusting for refraction.
  The HA,Dec is obtained by rotating back into equatorial
  coordinates, using the geodetic latitude corrected for polar
  motion, and is the position that would be seen by a perfect
  equatorial located at the observer and with its polar axis
  aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation (n.b. not to the
  refracted pole).  Finally, the RA is obtained by subtracting
  the HA from the local apparent ST.

- To predict the required setting of a real telescope, the
  observed place produced by this routine would have to be
  adjusted for the tilt of the azimuth or polar axis of the
  mounting (with appropriate corrections for mount flexures),
  for non-perpendicularity between the mounting axes, for the
  position of the rotator axis and the pointing axis relative
  to it, for tube flexure, for gear and encoder errors, and
  finally for encoder zero points.  Some telescopes would, of
  course, exhibit other properties which would need to be
  accounted for at the appropriate point in the sequence.

- This routine takes time to execute, due mainly to the
  rigorous integration used to evaluate the refraction.
  For processing multiple stars for one location and time,
  call palAoppa once followed by one call per star to palAopqk.
  Where a range of times within a limited period of a few hours
  is involved, and the highest precision is not required, call
  palAoppa once, followed by a call to palAoppat each time the
  time changes, followed by one call per star to palAopqk.

- The DATE argument is UTC expressed as an MJD.  This is,
  strictly speaking, wrong, because of leap seconds.  However,
  as long as the delta UT and the UTC are consistent there
  are no difficulties, except during a leap second.  In this
  case, the start of the 61st second of the final minute should
  begin a new MJD day and the old pre-leap delta UT should
  continue to be used.  As the 61st second completes, the MJD
  should revert to the start of the day as, simultaneously,
  the delta UTC changes by one second to its post-leap new value.

- The delta UT (UT1-UTC) is tabulated in IERS circulars and
  elsewhere.  It increases by exactly one second at the end of
  each UTC leap second, introduced in order to keep delta UT
  within +/- 0.9 seconds.

- IMPORTANT -- TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN CONVENTION.
  The longitude required by the present routine is east-positive,
  in accordance with geographical convention (and right-handed).
  In particular, note that the longitudes returned by the
  palObs routine are west-positive, following astronomical
  usage, and must be reversed in sign before use in the present
  routine.

- The polar coordinates XP,YP can be obtained from IERS
  circulars and equivalent publications.  The maximum amplitude
  is about 0.3 arcseconds.  If XP,YP values are unavailable,
  use XP=YP=0.0.  See page B60 of the 1988 Astronomical Almanac
  for a definition of the two angles.

- The height above sea level of the observing station, HM,
  can be obtained from the Astronomical Almanac (Section J
  in the 1988 edition), or via the routine palObs.  If P,
  the pressure in millibars, is available, an adequate
  estimate of HM can be obtained from the expression

        HM ~ -29.3*TSL*LOG(P/1013.25).

  where TSL is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
  (see Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition,
  section 52).  Similarly, if the pressure P is not known,
  it can be estimated from the height of the observing
  station, HM, as follows:

        P ~ 1013.25*EXP(-HM/(29.3*TSL)).

  Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to the
  pressure and that an accurate P value is important for precise
  work.

- The azimuths etc produced by the present routine are with
  respect to the celestial pole.  Corrections to the terrestrial
  pole can be computed using palPolmo.

- Repeated, computationally-expensive, calls to palAoppa for

  observed RA,Dec predicted by this routine should be within
  about 0.1 arcsec for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees.
  Even at a topocentric zenith distance of 90 degrees, the
  accuracy in elevation should be better than 1 arcmin;  useful
  results are available for a further 3 degrees, beyond which
  the palRefro routine returns a fixed value of the refraction.
  The complementary routines palAop (or palAopqk) and palOap
  (or palOapqk) are self-consistent to better than 1 micro-
  arcsecond all over the celestial sphere.

- It is advisable to take great care with units, as even
  unlikely values of the input parameters are accepted and
  processed in accordance with the models used.

- "Apparent" place means the geocentric apparent right ascension
  and declination, which is obtained from a catalogue mean place
  by allowing for space motion, parallax, precession, nutation,
  annual aberration, and the Sun's gravitational lens effect.  For
  star positions in the FK5 system (i.e. J2000), these effects can
  be applied by means of the palMap etc routines.  Starting from
  other mean place systems, additional transformations will be
  needed;  for example, FK4 (i.e. B1950) mean places would first
  have to be converted to FK5, which can be done with the
  palFk425 etc routines.

- "Observed" Az,El means the position that would be seen by a
  perfect theodolite located at the observer.  This is obtained
  from the geocentric apparent RA,Dec by allowing for Earth
  orientation and diurnal aberration, rotating from equator
  to horizon coordinates, and then adjusting for refraction.
  The HA,Dec is obtained by rotating back into equatorial
  coordinates, using the geodetic latitude corrected for polar
  motion, and is the position that would be seen by a perfect
  equatorial located at the observer and with its polar axis
  aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation (n.b. not to the
  refracted pole).  Finally, the RA is obtained by subtracting
  the HA from the local apparent ST.

- To predict the required setting of a real telescope, the
  observed place produced by this routine would have to be
  adjusted for the tilt of the azimuth or polar axis of the
  mounting (with appropriate corrections for mount flexures),
  for non-perpendicularity between the mounting axes, for the
  position of the rotator axis and the pointing axis relative
  to it, for tube flexure, for gear and encoder errors, and
  finally for encoder zero points.  Some telescopes would, of
  course, exhibit other properties which would need to be
  accounted for at the appropriate point in the sequence.

- The star-independent apparent-to-observed-place parameters
  in AOPRMS may be computed by means of the palAoppa routine.
  If nothing has changed significantly except the time, the
  palAoppat routine may be used to perform the requisite
  partial recomputation of AOPRMS.

- At zenith distances beyond about 76 degrees, the need for
  special care with the corrections for refraction causes a
  marked increase in execution time.  Moreover, the effect
  gets worse with increasing zenith distance.  Adroit
  programming in the calling application may allow the
  problem to be reduced.  Prepare an alternative AOPRMS array,
  computed for zero air-pressure;  this will disable the
  refraction corrections and cause rapid execution.  Using
  this AOPRMS array, a preliminary call to the present routine
  will, depending on the application, produce a rough position
  which may be enough to establish whether the full, slow
  calculation (using the real AOPRMS array) is worthwhile.
  For example, there would be no need for the full calculation
  if the preliminary call had already established that the
  source was well below the elevation limits for a particular
  telescope.

- The azimuths etc produced by the present routine are with
  respect to the celestial pole.  Corrections to the terrestrial
  pole can be computed using palPolmo.

Notes
-----
- To use this routine, first call palRefco specifying WL1 as the
wavelength.  This yields refraction coefficients A1,B1, correct
for that wavelength.  Subsequently, calls to palAtmdsp specifying
different wavelengths will produce new, slightly adjusted
refraction coefficients which apply to the specified wavelength.

- Most of the atmospheric dispersion happens between 0.7 micrometre
and the UV atmospheric cutoff, and the effect increases strongly
towards the UV end.  For this reason a blue reference wavelength
is recommended, for example 0.4 micrometres.

- The accuracy, for this set of conditions:

   height above sea level    2000 m
                 latitude    29 deg
                 pressure    793 mb
              temperature    17 degC
                 humidity    50%
               lapse rate    0.0065 degC/m
     reference wavelength    0.4 micrometre
           star elevation    15 deg

is about 2.5 mas RMS between 0.3 and 1.0 micrometres, and stays
within 4 mas for the whole range longward of 0.3 micrometres
(compared with a total dispersion from 0.3 to 20.0 micrometres
of about 11 arcsec).  These errors are typical for ordinary
conditions and the given elevation;  in extreme conditions values
a few times this size may occur, while at higher elevations the
errors become much smaller.

- If either wavelength exceeds 100 micrometres, the radio case
is assumed and the returned refraction coefficients are the
same as the given ones.  Note that radio refraction coefficients
cannot be turned into optical values using this routine, nor
vice versa.

- The algorithm consists of calculation of the refractivity of the
air at the observer for the two wavelengths, using the methods
of the palRefro routine, and then scaling of the two refraction
coefficients according to classical refraction theory.  This
amounts to scaling the A coefficient in proportion to (n-1) and
the B coefficient almost in the same ratio (see R.M.Green,
"Spherical Astronomy", Cambridge University Press, 1985).

Notes
-----
- Meeus quotes accuracies of 10 arcsec in longitude, 3 arcsec in
  latitude and 0.2 arcsec in HP (equivalent to about 20 km in
  distance).  Comparison with JPL DE200 over the interval
  1960-2025 gives RMS errors of 3.7 arcsec and 83 mas/hour in
  longitude, 2.3 arcsec and 48 mas/hour in latitude, 11 km
  and 81 mm/s in distance.  The maximum errors over the same
  interval are 18 arcsec and 0.50 arcsec/hour in longitude,
  11 arcsec and 0.24 arcsec/hour in latitude, 40 km and 0.29 m/s
  in distance.
- The original algorithm is expressed in terms of the obsolete
  timescale Ephemeris Time.  Either TDB or TT can be used, but
  not UT without incurring significant errors (30 arcsec at
  the present time) due to the Moon's 0.5 arcsec/sec movement.
- The algorithm is based on pre IAU 1976 standards.  However,
  the result has been moved onto the new (FK5) equinox, an
  adjustment which is in any case much smaller than the
  intrinsic accuracy of the procedure.
- Velocity is obtained by a complete analytical differentiation
  of the Meeus model.

    after 1708    McCarthy & Babcock's post-1650 model

  The breakpoints are chosen to ensure continuity:  they occur
  at places where the adjacent models give the same answer as
  each other.
- The accuracy is modest, with errors of up to 20 sec during
  the interval since 1650, rising to perhaps 30 min by 1000 BC.
  Comparatively accurate values from AD 1600 are tabulated in
  the Astronomical Almanac (see section K8 of the 1995 AA).

Notes
-----
- The RAZ1 and RAZ2 values are returned in the range 0-2pi.
- Cases where there is no solution can only arise near the poles.
  For example, it is clearly impossible for a star at the pole
  itself to have a non-zero XI value, and hence it is
  meaningless to ask where the tangent point would have to be
  to bring about this combination of XI and DEC.
- Also near the poles, cases can arise where there are two useful
  solutions.  The argument N indicates whether the second of the
  two solutions returned is useful.  N=1 indicates only one useful
  solution, the usual case;  under these circumstances, the second
  solution corresponds to the "over-the-pole" case, and this is
  reflected in the values of RAZ2 and DECZ2 which are returned.
- The DECZ1 and DECZ2 values are returned in the range +/-pi, but
  in the usual, non-pole-crossing, case, the range is +/-pi/2.
- This routine is the spherical equivalent of the routine sla_DTPV2C.

         - -5 = numerical error


Notes
-----
- The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
  purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference).
  They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
  and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
  at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
  quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
  information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
  computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
  are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
  orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
  outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
  estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
  date and (v) that date.
- The companion routine is palUe2pv.  This takes the set of numbers
  that the present routine outputs and uses them to derive the
  object's position and velocity.  A single prediction requires one
  call to the present routine followed by one call to palUe2pv;
  for convenience, the two calls are packaged as the routine
  palPlanel.  Multiple predictions may be made by again calling the
  present routine once, but then calling palUe2pv multiple times,
  which is faster than multiple calls to palPlanel.
- DATE is the epoch of osculation.  It is in the TT timescale
  (formerly Ephemeris Time, ET) and is a Modified Julian Date
  (JD-2400000.5).
- The supplied orbital elements are with respect to the J2000
  ecliptic and equinox.  The position and velocity parameters
  returned in the array U are with respect to the mean equator and
  equinox of epoch J2000, and are for the perihelion prior to the
  specified epoch.
- The universal elements returned in the array U are in canonical
  units (solar masses, AU and canonical days).
- Three different element-format options are available:

  Option JFORM=1, suitable for the major planets:

  EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
  ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
  ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
  PERIH  = longitude of perihelion, curly pi (radians)
  AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
  E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to <1)
  AORL   = mean longitude L (radians)
  DM     = daily motion (radians)

  Option JFORM=2, suitable for minor planets:

  EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
  ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
  ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
  PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
  AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
  E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to <1)
  AORL   = mean anomaly M (radians)

  Option JFORM=3, suitable for comets:

  EPOCH  = epoch of perihelion (TT MJD)
  ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
  ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
  PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
  AORQ   = perihelion distance, q (AU)
  E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to 10)

- Unused elements (DM for JFORM=2, AORL and DM for JFORM=3) are
  not accessed.
- The algorithm was originally adapted from the EPHSLA program of
  D.H.P.Jones (private communication, 1996).  The method is based
  on Stumpff's Universal Variables.

Notes
-----
- The epoch BEPOCH is strictly speaking Besselian, but if a
Julian epoch is supplied the result will be affected only to
a negligible extent.

- Conversion from Besselian epoch 1950.0 to Julian epoch 2000.0
only is provided for.  Conversions involving other epochs will
require use of the appropriate precession, proper motion, and
E-terms routines before and/or after palFk45z is called.

- In the FK4 catalogue the proper motions of stars within 10
degrees of the poles do not embody the differential E-term effect
and should, strictly speaking, be handled in a different manner
from stars outside these regions. However, given the general lack
of homogeneity of the star data available for routine astrometry,
the difficulties of handling positions that may have been
determined from astrometric fields spanning the polar and non-polar
regions, the likelihood that the differential E-terms effect was not
taken into account when allowing for proper motion in past
astrometry, and the undesirability of a discontinuity in the
algorithm, the decision has been made in this routine to include the
effect of differential E-terms on the proper motions for all stars,
whether polar or not.  At epoch 2000, and measuring on the sky rather
than in terms of dRA, the errors resulting from this simplification
are less than 1 milliarcsecond in position and 1 milliarcsecond per
century in proper motion.

Notes
-----
- The proper motions in RA are dRA/dt rather than
cos(Dec)*dRA/dt, and are per year rather than per century.
- Note that conversion from Julian epoch 2000.0 to Besselian
epoch 1950.0 only is provided for.  Conversions involving
other epochs will require use of the appropriate precession,
proper motion, and E-terms routines before and/or after
FK524 is called.
- In the FK4 catalogue the proper motions of stars within
10 degrees of the poles do not embody the differential
E-term effect and should, strictly speaking, be handled
in a different manner from stars outside these regions.
However, given the general lack of homogeneity of the star
data available for routine astrometry, the difficulties of
handling positions that may have been determined from
astrometric fields spanning the polar and non-polar regions,
the likelihood that the differential E-terms effect was not
taken into account when allowing for proper motion in past
astrometry, and the undesirability of a discontinuity in
the algorithm, the decision has been made in this routine to
include the effect of differential E-terms on the proper
motions for all stars, whether polar or not.  At epoch 2000,
and measuring on the sky rather than in terms of dRA, the
errors resulting from this simplification are less than
1 milliarcsecond in position and 1 milliarcsecond per
century in proper motion.

Notes
-----
- Calls palMappa and palMapqk
- The reference systems and timescales used are IAU 2006.
- EQ is the Julian epoch specifying both the reference frame and
  the epoch of the position - usually 2000.  For positions where
  the epoch and equinox are different, use the routine palPm to
  apply proper motion corrections before using this routine.

- The distinction between the required TDB and TT is always
  negligible.  Moreover, for all but the most critical
  applications UTC is adequate.

- The proper motions in RA are dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.

- This routine may be wasteful for some applications because it
  recomputes the Earth position/velocity and the precession-
  nutation matrix each time, and because it allows for parallax
  and proper motion.  Where multiple transformations are to be
  carried out for one epoch, a faster method is to call the
  palMappa routine once and then either the palMapqk routine
  (which includes parallax and proper motion) or palMapqkz (which
  assumes zero parallax and proper motion).

- The accuracy is sub-milliarcsecond, limited by the
  precession-nutation model (see palPrenut for details).

- The accuracy is further limited by the routine palEvp, called
  by palMappa, which computes the Earth position and velocity.
  See eraEpv00 for details on that calculation.

Notes
-----
- Only the first character of the TYPE argument is significant.
'R' or 'r' indicates that OBS1 and OBS2 are the observed right
ascension and declination;  'H' or 'h' indicates that they are
hour angle (west +ve) and declination;  anything else ('A' or
'a' is recommended) indicates that OBS1 and OBS2 are azimuth
(north zero, east 90 deg) and zenith distance.  (Zenith
distance is used rather than elevation in order to reflect the
fact that no allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)

- The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
refraction.  Providing the meteorological parameters are
known accurately and there are no gross local effects, the
predicted apparent RA,Dec should be within about 0.1 arcsec
for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees.  Even at a
topocentric zenith distance of 90 degrees, the accuracy in
elevation should be better than 1 arcmin;  useful results
are available for a further 3 degrees, beyond which the
palRefro routine returns a fixed value of the refraction.
The complementary routines palAop (or palAopqk) and palOap
(or palOapqk) are self-consistent to better than 1 micro-
arcsecond all over the celestial sphere.

- It is advisable to take great care with units, as even
unlikely values of the input parameters are accepted and
processed in accordance with the models used.

- "Observed" Az,El means the position that would be seen by a
perfect theodolite located at the observer.  This is
related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
observed HA and RA are related simply through the local
apparent ST.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus means the
position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial located
at the observer and with its polar axis aligned to the
Earth's axis of rotation (n.b. not to the refracted pole).
By removing from the observed place the effects of
atmospheric refraction and diurnal aberration, the
geocentric apparent RA,Dec is obtained.

- Frequently, mean rather than apparent RA,Dec will be required,
in which case further transformations will be necessary.  The
palAmp etc routines will convert the apparent RA,Dec produced
by the present routine into an "FK5" (J2000) mean place, by
allowing for the Sun's gravitational lens effect, annual
aberration, nutation and precession.  Should "FK4" (1950)
coordinates be needed, the routines palFk524 etc will also
need to be applied.

- To convert to apparent RA,Dec the coordinates read from a
real telescope, corrections would have to be applied for
encoder zero points, gear and encoder errors, tube flexure,
the position of the rotator axis and the pointing axis
relative to it, non-perpendicularity between the mounting
axes, and finally for the tilt of the azimuth or polar axis
of the mounting (with appropriate corrections for mount
flexures).  Some telescopes would, of course, exhibit other
properties which would need to be accounted for at the
appropriate point in the sequence.

- This routine takes time to execute, due mainly to the rigorous
integration used to evaluate the refraction.  For processing
multiple stars for one location and time, call palAoppa once
followed by one call per star to palOapqk.  Where a range of
times within a limited period of a few hours is involved, and the
highest precision is not required, call palAoppa once, followed
by a call to palAoppat each time the time changes, followed by
one call per star to palOapqk.

- The DATE argument is UTC expressed as an MJD.  This is, strictly
speaking, wrong, because of leap seconds.  However, as long as
the delta UT and the UTC are consistent there are no
difficulties, except during a leap second.  In this case, the
start of the 61st second of the final minute should begin a new
MJD day and the old pre-leap delta UT should continue to be used.
As the 61st second completes, the MJD should revert to the start
of the day as, simultaneously, the delta UTC changes by one
second to its post-leap new value.

- The delta UT (UT1-UTC) is tabulated in IERS circulars and
elsewhere.  It increases by exactly one second at the end of
each UTC leap second, introduced in order to keep delta UT
within +/- 0.9 seconds.

- IMPORTANT -- TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN CONVENTION.
The longitude required by the present routine is east-positive,
in accordance with geographical convention (and right-handed).
In particular, note that the longitudes returned by the
palOBS routine are west-positive, following astronomical
usage, and must be reversed in sign before use in the present
routine.

- The polar coordinates XP,YP can be obtained from IERS
circulars and equivalent publications.  The maximum amplitude
is about 0.3 arcseconds.  If XP,YP values are unavailable,
use XP=YP=0D0.  See page B60 of the 1988 Astronomical Almanac
for a definition of the two angles.

- The height above sea level of the observing station, HM,
can be obtained from the Astronomical Almanac (Section J
in the 1988 edition), or via the routine palOBS.  If P,
the pressure in millibars, is available, an adequate
estimate of HM can be obtained from the expression

       HM ~ -29.3*TSL*LOG(P/1013.25).

where TSL is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
(see Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition,
section 52).  Similarly, if the pressure P is not known,
it can be estimated from the height of the observing
station, HM, as follows:

       P ~ 1013.25*EXP(-HM/(29.3*TSL)).

Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to the
pressure and that an accurate P value is important for precise
work.

- The azimuths etc. used by the present routine are with respect
to the celestial pole.  Corrections from the terrestrial pole
can be computed using palPolmo.

Notes
-----
- "Mean" longitude and latitude are the (fixed) values for the
  site's location with respect to the IERS terrestrial reference
  frame;  the latitude is geodetic.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE
  SIGN CONVENTION.  The longitudes used by the present routine
  are east-positive, in accordance with geographical convention
  (and right-handed).  In particular, note that the longitudes
  returned by the sla_OBS routine are west-positive, following
  astronomical usage, and must be reversed in sign before use in
  the present routine.

- XP and YP are the (changing) coordinates of the Celestial
  Ephemeris Pole with respect to the IERS Reference Pole.
  XP is positive along the meridian at longitude 0 degrees,
  and YP is positive along the meridian at longitude
  270 degrees (i.e. 90 degrees west).  Values for XP,YP can
  be obtained from IERS circulars and equivalent publications;
  the maximum amplitude observed so far is about 0.3 arcseconds.

- "True" longitude and latitude are the (moving) values for
  the site's location with respect to the celestial ephemeris
  pole and the meridian which corresponds to the Greenwich
  apparent sidereal time.  The true longitude and latitude
  link the terrestrial coordinates with the standard celestial
  models (for precession, nutation, sidereal time etc).

- The azimuths produced by sla_AOP and sla_AOPQK are with
  respect to due north as defined by the Celestial Ephemeris
  Pole, and can therefore be called "celestial azimuths".
  However, a telescope fixed to the Earth measures azimuth
  essentially with respect to due north as defined by the
  IERS Reference Pole, and can therefore be called "terrestrial
  azimuth".  Uncorrected, this would manifest itself as a
  changing "azimuth zero-point error".  The value DAZ is the
  correction to be added to a celestial azimuth to produce
  a terrestrial azimuth.

- The present routine is rigorous.  For most practical
  purposes, the following simplified formulae provide an
  adequate approximation:

  elong = elongm+xp*cos(elongm)-yp*sin(elongm)
  phi   = phim+(xp*sin(elongm)+yp*cos(elongm))*tan(phim)
  daz   = -sqrt(xp*xp+yp*yp)*cos(elongm-atan2(xp,yp))/cos(phim)

  An alternative formulation for DAZ is:

  x = cos(elongm)*cos(phim)
  y = sin(elongm)*cos(phim)
  daz = atan2(-x*yp-y*xp,x*x+y*y)

  ANODE   = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
  PERIH   = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
  AORQ    = mean distance, a (AU)
  E       = eccentricity, e
  AM      = mean anomaly M (radians)

  Option JFORM=3, suitable for comets:

  ORBI    = inclination i (radians)
  ANODE   = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
  PERIH   = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
  AORQ    = perihelion distance, q (AU)
  E       = eccentricity, e

- DATE0, DATE1, EPOCH0 and EPOCH1 are all instants of time in
  the TT timescale (formerly Ephemeris Time, ET), expressed
  as Modified Julian Dates (JD-2400000.5).

  DATE0 is the instant at which the given (i.e. unperturbed)
  osculating elements are correct.

  DATE1 is the specified instant at which the updated osculating
  elements are correct.

  EPOCH0 and EPOCH1 will be the same as DATE0 and DATE1
  (respectively) for the JFORM=2 case, normally used for minor
  planets.  For the JFORM=3 case, the two epochs will refer to
  perihelion passage and so will not, in general, be the same as
  DATE0 and/or DATE1 though they may be similar to one another.
- The elements are with respect to the J2000 ecliptic and equinox.
- Unused elements (AM0 and AM1 for JFORM=3) are not accessed.
- See the palPertue routine for details of the algorithm used.
- This routine is not intended to be used for major planets, which
  is why JFORM=1 is not available and why there is no opportunity
  to specify either the longitude of perihelion or the daily
  motion.  However, if JFORM=2 elements are somehow obtained for a
  major planet and supplied to the routine, sensible results will,
  in fact, be produced.  This happens because the palPertue routine
  that is called to perform the calculations checks the separation
  between the body and each of the planets and interprets a
  suspiciously small value (0.001 AU) as an attempt to apply it to
  the planet concerned.  If this condition is detected, the
  contribution from that planet is ignored, and the status is set to
  the planet number (1-10 = Mercury, Venus, EMB, Mars, Jupiter,
  Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Earth, Moon) as a warning.

Notes
-----
- The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
  purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference 2).
  They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
  and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
  at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
  quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
  information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
  computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
  are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
  orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
  outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
  estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
  date and (v) that date.
- The universal elements are with respect to the J2000 equator and
  equinox.
- The epochs DATE, U(3) and U(12) are all Modified Julian Dates
  (JD-2400000.5).
- The algorithm is a simplified form of Encke's method.  It takes as
  a basis the unperturbed motion of the body, and numerically
  integrates the perturbing accelerations from the major planets.
  The expression used is essentially Sterne's 6.7-2 (reference 1).
  Everhart and Pitkin (reference 2) suggest rectifying the orbit at
  each integration step by propagating the new perturbed position
  and velocity as the new universal variables.  In the present
  routine the orbit is rectified less frequently than this, in order
  to gain a slight speed advantage.  However, the rectification is
  done directly in terms of position and velocity, as suggested by
  Everhart and Pitkin, bypassing the use of conventional orbital
  elements.

  The f(q) part of the full Encke method is not used.  The purpose
  of this part is to avoid subtracting two nearly equal quantities
  when calculating the "indirect member", which takes account of the
  small change in the Sun's attraction due to the slightly displaced
  position of the perturbed body.  A simpler, direct calculation in
  double precision proves to be faster and not significantly less
  accurate.

  Apart from employing a variable timestep, and occasionally
  "rectifying the orbit" to keep the indirect member small, the
  integration is done in a fairly straightforward way.  The
  acceleration estimated for the middle of the timestep is assumed
  to apply throughout that timestep;  it is also used in the
  extrapolation of the perturbations to the middle of the next
  timestep, to predict the new disturbed position.  There is no
  iteration within a timestep.

  Measures are taken to reach a compromise between execution time
  and accuracy.  The starting-point is the goal of achieving
  arcsecond accuracy for ordinary minor planets over a ten-year
  timespan.  This goal dictates how large the timesteps can be,
  which in turn dictates how frequently the unperturbed motion has
  to be recalculated from the osculating elements.

  Within predetermined limits, the timestep for the numerical
  integration is varied in length in inverse proportion to the
  magnitude of the net acceleration on the body from the major
  planets.

  The numerical integration requires estimates of the major-planet
  motions.  Approximate positions for the major planets (Pluto
  alone is omitted) are obtained from the routine palPlanet.  Two
  levels of interpolation are used, to enhance speed without
  significantly degrading accuracy.  At a low frequency, the routine
  palPlanet is called to generate updated position+velocity "state
  vectors".  The only task remaining to be carried out at the full
  frequency (i.e. at each integration step) is to use the state
  vectors to extrapolate the planetary positions.  In place of a
  strictly linear extrapolation, some allowance is made for the
  curvature of the orbit by scaling back the radius vector as the
  linear extrapolation goes off at a tangent.

  Various other approximations are made.  For example, perturbations
  by Pluto and the minor planets are neglected and relativistic
  effects are not taken into account.

  In the interests of simplicity, the background calculations for
  the major planets are carried out en masse.  The mean elements and
  state vectors for all the planets are refreshed at the same time,
  without regard for orbit curvature, mass or proximity.

  The Earth-Moon system is treated as a single body when the body is
  distant but as separate bodies when closer to the EMB than the
  parameter RNE, which incurs a time penalty but improves accuracy
  for near-Earth objects.

- This routine is not intended to be used for major planets.
  However, if major-planet elements are supplied, sensible results
  will, in fact, be produced.  This happens because the routine
  checks the separation between the body and each of the planets and
  interprets a suspiciously small value (0.001 AU) as an attempt to
  apply the routine to the planet concerned.  If this condition is
  detected, the contribution from that planet is ignored, and the
  status is set to the planet number (1-10 = Mercury, Venus, EMB,
  Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Earth, Moon) as a warning.

- Each of the three element sets defines an unperturbed heliocentric
  orbit.  For a given epoch of observation, the position of the body
  in its orbit can be predicted from these elements, which are
  called "osculating elements", using standard two-body analytical
  solutions.  However, due to planetary perturbations, a given set
  of osculating elements remains usable for only as long as the
  unperturbed orbit that it describes is an adequate approximation
  to reality.  Attached to such a set of elements is a date called
  the "osculating epoch", at which the elements are, momentarily,
  a perfect representation of the instantaneous position and
  velocity of the body.

  Therefore, for any given problem there are up to three different
  epochs in play, and it is vital to distinguish clearly between
  them:

  . The epoch of observation:  the moment in time for which the
    position of the body is to be predicted.

  . The epoch defining the position of the body:  the moment in time
    at which, in the absence of purturbations, the specified
    position (mean longitude, mean anomaly, or perihelion) is
    reached.

  . The osculating epoch:  the moment in time at which the given
    elements are correct.

  For the major-planet and minor-planet cases it is usual to make
  the epoch that defines the position of the body the same as the
  epoch of osculation.  Thus, only two different epochs are
  involved:  the epoch of the elements and the epoch of observation.

  For comets, the epoch of perihelion fixes the position in the
  orbit and in general a different epoch of osculation will be
  chosen.  Thus, all three types of epoch are involved.

  For the present routine:

  . The epoch of observation is the argument DATE.

  . The epoch defining the position of the body is the argument
    EPOCH.

  . The osculating epoch is not used and is assumed to be close
    enough to the epoch of observation to deliver adequate accuracy.
    If not, a preliminary call to palPertel may be used to update
    the element-set (and its associated osculating epoch) by
    applying planetary perturbations.
- The reference frame for the result is with respect to the mean
  equator and equinox of epoch J2000.
- The algorithm was originally adapted from the EPHSLA program of
  D.H.P.Jones (private communication, 1996).  The method is based
  on Stumpff's Universal Variables.

- The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the

  They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
  and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
  at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
  quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
  information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
  computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
  are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
  orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
  outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
  estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
  date and (v) that date.
- The universal elements are with respect to the J2000 equator and

- Uses eraStarpm but ignores the status returns from that routine.
  In particular note that parallax should not be zero when the
  proper motions are non-zero. SLA/F allows parallax to be zero.
- Assumes all epochs are Julian epochs.

- Uses palPrec for FK5 data and palPrebn for FK4 data.

        palPreces( "FK4", 1900.0, 1950.0, &ra, &dc );
- This routine will NOT correctly convert between the old and
  the new systems - for example conversion from B1950 to J2000.
  For these purposes see palFk425, palFk524, palFk45z and

Notes
-----
- The PV 6-vector is with respect to the mean equator and equinox of

  the J2000 ecliptic and mean equinox.
- The mass, PMASS, is important only for the larger planets.  For
  most purposes (e.g. asteroids) use 0D0.  Values less than zero
  are illegal.
- Three different element-format options are supported:

  Option JFORM=1, suitable for the major planets:

  EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
  ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
  ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
  PERIH  = longitude of perihelion, curly pi (radians)
  AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
  E      = eccentricity, e
  AORL   = mean longitude L (radians)
  DM     = daily motion (radians)

  Option JFORM=2, suitable for minor planets:

  EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
  ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
  ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
  PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
  AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
  E      = eccentricity, e
  AORL   = mean anomaly M (radians)

  Option JFORM=3, suitable for comets:

  ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
  PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
  AORQ   = perihelion distance, q (AU)
  E      = eccentricity, e

     3        3       OK - elements are in the requested format

- The arguments returned for each value of JFORM (cf Note 5: JFORM

    n              "    daily motion (radians)
    -             means no value is set

- At very small inclinations, the longitude of the ascending node
  ANODE becomes indeterminate and under some circumstances may be
  set arbitrarily to zero.  Similarly, if the orbit is close to
  circular, the true anomaly becomes indeterminate and under some
  circumstances may be set arbitrarily to zero.  In such cases,
  the other elements are automatically adjusted to compensate,
  and so the elements remain a valid description of the orbit.
- The osculating epoch for the returned elements is the argument
  DATE.

Notes

- The PV 6-vector can be with respect to any chosen inertial frame,

  the same frame.  A common choice will be mean equator and ecliptic
  of epoch J2000.
- The mass, PMASS, is important only for the larger planets.  For
  most purposes (e.g. asteroids) use 0D0.  Values less than zero
  are illegal.
- The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
  purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference).
  They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
  and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
  at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
  quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
  information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
  computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
  are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
  orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
  outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
  estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
  date and (v) that date.

Notes
-----
- A suggested value for the TLR argument is 0.0065.  The
refraction is significantly affected by TLR, and if studies
of the local atmosphere have been carried out a better TLR
value may be available.  The sign of the supplied TLR value
is ignored.

- A suggested value for the EPS argument is 1E-8.  The result is
usually at least two orders of magnitude more computationally
precise than the supplied EPS value.

- The routine computes the refraction for zenith distances up
to and a little beyond 90 deg using the method of Hohenkerk
and Sinclair (NAO Technical Notes 59 and 63, subsequently adopted
in the Explanatory Supplement, 1992 edition - see section 3.281).

- The code is a development of the optical/IR refraction subroutine
AREF of C.Hohenkerk (HMNAO, September 1984), with extensions to
support the radio case.  Apart from merely cosmetic changes, the
following modifications to the original HMNAO optical/IR refraction
code have been made:

.  The angle arguments have been changed to radians.

.  Any value of ZOBS is allowed (see note 6, below).

.  Other argument values have been limited to safe values.

.  Murray's values for the gas constants have been used
   (Vectorial Astrometry, Adam Hilger, 1983).

.  The numerical integration phase has been rearranged for
   extra clarity.

.  A better model for Ps(T) has been adopted (taken from
   Gill, Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics, Academic Press, 1982).

.  More accurate expressions for Pwo have been adopted
   (again from Gill 1982).

.  The formula for the water vapour pressure, given the
   saturation pressure and the relative humidity, is from
   Crane (1976), expression 2.5.5.
.  Provision for radio wavelengths has been added using
   expressions devised by A.T.Sinclair, RGO (private
   communication 1989).  The refractivity model currently
   used is from J.M.Rueger, "Refractive Index Formulae for
   Electronic Distance Measurement with Radio and Millimetre
   Waves", in Unisurv Report S-68 (2002), School of Surveying
   and Spatial Information Systems, University of New South
   Wales, Sydney, Australia.

.  The optical refractivity for dry air is from Resolution 3 of
   the International Association of Geodesy adopted at the XXIIth
   General Assembly in Birmingham, UK, 1999.

.  Various small changes have been made to gain speed.

- The radio refraction is chosen by specifying WL > 100 micrometres.
Because the algorithm takes no account of the ionosphere, the
accuracy deteriorates at low frequencies, below about 30 MHz.

- Before use, the value of ZOBS is expressed in the range +/- pi.
If this ranged ZOBS is -ve, the result REF is computed from its
absolute value before being made -ve to match.  In addition, if
it has an absolute value greater than 93 deg, a fixed REF value
equal to the result for ZOBS = 93 deg is returned, appropriately
signed.

- As in the original Hohenkerk and Sinclair algorithm, fixed values
of the water vapour polytrope exponent, the height of the
tropopause, and the height at which refraction is negligible are
used.

- The radio refraction has been tested against work done by
Iain Coulson, JACH, (private communication 1995) for the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, Mauna Kea.  For typical conditions,
agreement at the 0.1 arcsec level is achieved for moderate ZD,
worsening to perhaps 0.5-1.0 arcsec at ZD 80 deg.  At hot and
humid sea-level sites the accuracy will not be as good.

- It should be noted that the relative humidity RH is formally
defined in terms of "mixing ratio" rather than pressures or
densities as is often stated.  It is the mass of water per unit
mass of dry air divided by that for saturated air at the same
temperature and pressure (see Gill 1982).
- The algorithm is designed for observers in the troposphere. The
supplied temperature, pressure and lapse rate are assumed to be
for a point in the troposphere and are used to define a model
atmosphere with the tropopause at 11km altitude and a constant
temperature above that.  However, in practice, the refraction
values returned for stratospheric observers, at altitudes up to
25km, are quite usable.

Notes
-----
- This routine applies the adjustment for refraction in the
opposite sense to the usual one - it takes an unrefracted
(in vacuo) position and produces an observed (refracted)
position, whereas the A tan Z + B tan**3 Z model strictly
applies to the case where an observed position is to have the
refraction removed.  The unrefracted to refracted case is
harder, and requires an inverted form of the text-book
refraction models;  the algorithm used here is equivalent to
one iteration of the Newton-Raphson method applied to the above
formula.

- Though optimized for speed rather than precision, the present
routine achieves consistency with the refracted-to-unrefracted
A tan Z + B tan**3 Z model at better than 1 microarcsecond within
30 degrees of the zenith and remains within 1 milliarcsecond to
beyond ZD 70 degrees.  The inherent accuracy of the model is, of
course, far worse than this - see the documentation for palRefco
for more information.

- At low elevations (below about 3 degrees) the refraction
correction is held back to prevent arithmetic problems and
wildly wrong results.  For optical/IR wavelengths, over a wide
range of observer heights and corresponding temperatures and
pressures, the following levels of accuracy (arcsec, worst case)
are achieved, relative to numerical integration through a model
atmosphere:

         ZD    error

         80      0.7

The results for radio are slightly worse over most of the range,
becoming significantly worse below ZD=88 and unusable beyond
ZD=90.

- See also the routine palRefz, which performs the adjustment to
the zenith distance rather than in Cartesian Az/El coordinates.
The present routine is faster than palRefz and, except very low down,
is equally accurate for all practical purposes.  However, beyond
about ZD 84 degrees palRefz should be used, and for the utmost
accuracy iterative use of palRefro should be considered.

carried out, achieving agreement at the 1D-11 arcseconds level
for a ZD of 80 degrees.  The inherent accuracy of the model
is, of course, far worse than this - see the documentation for
palRefco for more information.

- At ZD 83 degrees, the rapidly-worsening A tan Z + B tan^3 Z
model is abandoned and an empirical formula takes over.  For
optical/IR wavelengths, over a wide range of observer heights and
corresponding temperatures and pressures, the following levels of
accuracy (arcsec, worst case) are achieved, relative to numerical
integration through a model atmosphere:

         ZR    error

         91    150         } relevant only to
         92    400         } high-elevation sites

For radio wavelengths the errors are typically 50% larger than
the optical figures and by ZD 85 deg are twice as bad, worsening
rapidly below that.  To maintain 1 arcsec accuracy down to ZD=85
at the Green Bank site, Condon (2004) has suggested amplifying
the amount of refraction predicted by palRefz below 10.8 deg
elevation by the factor (1+0.00195*(10.8-E_t)), where E_t is the
unrefracted elevation in degrees.

The high-ZD model is scaled to match the normal model at the
transition point;  there is no glitch.

- Beyond 93 deg zenith distance, the refraction is held at its
93 deg value.

- See also the routine palRefv, which performs the adjustment in
Cartesian Az/El coordinates, and with the emphasis on speed
rather than numerical accuracy.

Notes
-----
- The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
  purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference 2).
  They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
  and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
  at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
  quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
  information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
  computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
  are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
  orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
  outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
  estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
  date and (v) that date.
- The universal elements are with respect to the mean equator and
  equinox of epoch J2000.  The orbital elements produced are with
  respect to the J2000 ecliptic and mean equinox.
- Three different element-format options are supported:

   Option JFORM=1, suitable for the major planets:

- At very small inclinations, the longitude of the ascending node
  ANODE becomes indeterminate and under some circumstances may be
  set arbitrarily to zero.  Similarly, if the orbit is close to
  circular, the true anomaly becomes indeterminate and under some
  circumstances may be set arbitrarily to zero.  In such cases,
  the other elements are automatically adjusted to compensate,
  and so the elements remain a valid description of the orbit.

- The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
  purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference).
  They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
  and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
  at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
  quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
  information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
  computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
  are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
  orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
  outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
  estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
  date and (v) that date.
- The companion routine is palEl2ue.  This takes the conventional
  orbital elements and transforms them into the set of numbers
  needed by the present routine.  A single prediction requires one
  one call to palEl2ue followed by one call to the present routine;
  for convenience, the two calls are packaged as the routine
  palPlanel.  Multiple predictions may be made by again
  calling palEl2ue once, but then calling the present routine
  multiple times, which is faster than multiple calls to palPlanel.
- It is not obligatory to use palEl2ue to obtain the parameters.
  However, it should be noted that because palEl2ue performs its
  own validation, no checks on the contents of the array U are made
  by the present routine.
- DATE is the instant for which the prediction is required.  It is
  in the TT timescale (formerly Ephemeris Time, ET) and is a
  Modified Julian Date (JD-2400000.5).
- The universal elements supplied in the array U are in canonical
  units (solar masses, AU and canonical days).  The position and
  velocity are not sensitive to the choice of reference frame.  The
  palEl2ue routine in fact produces coordinates with respect to the
  J2000 equator and equinox.
- The algorithm was originally adapted from the EPHSLA program of
  D.H.P.Jones (private communication, 1996).  The method is based
  on Stumpff's Universal Variables.
