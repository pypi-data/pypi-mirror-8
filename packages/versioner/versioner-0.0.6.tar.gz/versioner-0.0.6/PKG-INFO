Description: Versioner
        =========
        
        Versioner is a very basic Python command-line tool and library to keep
        track of the version of your project, any kind of project.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install the last stable release of Versioner using pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install versioner
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Its usage is very simple. If you run ``versioner`` without arguments, it will
        print the version currently stored in a file named ``VERSION`` in the current
        folder. If such file does not exist, ``versioner`` creates it with an initial
        version of 0.0.1:
        
        ::
        
            $ versioner
            0.0.1
            $ cat VERSION
            0.0.1
        
        Versioner accepts a series of arguments to increase, decrease and set
        the three diferent categories, you can increase the major version number
        with:
        
        ::
        
            $ versioner +major
            1.0.1
        
        Or decrease the revision number with:
        
        ::
        
            $ versioner -revision
            1.0.0
        
        Or directly set the value of each component:
        
        ::
        
            $ versioner minor=2 revision=5
            1.2.5
        
        All this operations will update the ``VERSION`` file. As you can see,
        Versioner uses a three-digit versioning schema,
        ``major.minor.revision``, which should fit most needs. At the end of the
        day, if you need a different or more robust versioning schema, chances
        are you have the knowledge to build a more suitable tool yourself - or
        send a patch!
