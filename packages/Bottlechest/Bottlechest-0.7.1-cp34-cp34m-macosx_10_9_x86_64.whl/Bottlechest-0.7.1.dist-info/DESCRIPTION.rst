Introduction
============

Bottlechest is a fork of bottleneck (https://github.com/kwgoodman/bottleneck), specialized for use in Orange (https://github.com/biolab/orange3).

Moving window functions, several other functions and all optimization of 3d arrays are removed to reduce the size of the library. New functions are added as needed.

===================== =======================================================
NumPy/SciPy           ``median, nanmedian, rankdata, ss, nansum, nanmin,
                      nanmax, nanmean, nanstd, nanargmin, nanargmax`` 
Functions             ``nanrankdata, nanvar, replace, nn, anynan, allnan,
                      nanequal``
