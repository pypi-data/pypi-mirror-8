Description: Drat
        ====
        
        Text (readability) analysis tool written in Python (2.7 and 3).
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Drat is a tool that analyzes reading texts and produces a brief report
        which gives a readability score (according to the Dale-Chall readability
        formula) and the number of uncommon words (based on the General Service List)
        in the text. It also lists all of these uncommon words (if you choose the verbose option).
        
        There is now also support for the Coleman-Liau Readability Index.
        
        Drat supports **docx**, **odt**, **ods**, **odp** files as well as text
        files and urls.
        
        You can also analyze multiple texts / links by creating a text file
        with the filenames / links written in it.
        
        A simple example of how drat can be used in a web application is provided in the
        webapp directory.
