Beeswarm is a honeypot project which provides easy configuration, deployment and managment of honeypots.
Beeswarm operates by deploying fake end-user systems (clients) and services (honeypots). Beeswarm uses these systems to provides
IoC (Indication of Compromise) by observing the difference between expected and actual traffic. 
An IoC could be a certificate mismatch or the unexpected reuse of credentials (honeytokens).
