gphoto2-cffi
============

Python bindings for `libgphoto2`_ with an interface that strives to be
idiomatic. In contrast to other bindings for Python, gphoto2-cffi hides most
of the lower-level abstractions and reduces the API surface while still
offering access to most of the library's features.

.. code:: python

    import gphoto2 as gp

    # List all attached cameras that are supported
    cams = gp.list_cameras()

    # Get a camera instance by specifying a USB bus and device number
    my_cam = gp.Camera(bus=4, device=1)

    # Get an instance for the first supported camera
    my_cam = gp.Camera()
    # or
    my_cam = next(gp.list_cameras())

    # Capture an image to the camera's RAM and get its data
    imgdata = my_cam.capture()

    # Grab a preview from the camera
    previewdata = my_cam.get_preview()

    # Get a list of files on the camera
    files = tuple(my_cam.list_all_files())

    # Iterate over a file's content
    with open("image.jpg", "wb") as fp:
        for chunk in my_cam.files[0].iter_data():
            fp.write(chunk)

    # Get a configuration value
    image_quality = my_cam.config['capturesettings']['imagequality'].value
    # Set a configuration value
    my_cam.config['capturesettings']['imagequality'].set("JPEG Fine")

Currently only Python 2.7 and 3.4 (CPython and PyPy) are supported, however
support for 2.6 and 3.3 is planned for the future.
