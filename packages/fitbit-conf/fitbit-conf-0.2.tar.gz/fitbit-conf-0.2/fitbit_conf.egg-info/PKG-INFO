Description: Contains different useful tools and scripts for fitbit weightsite project.
        Currently, it has two main scripts: fitbit-ch and fitbit-dbup.
        
        fitbit-ch is used to change multiple file at the same time.
        
        fitbit-dbup is used to add db updates.
        
        Installation:
        Use python 3 or later. Open command line in this directory and run python setup.py install. After successful installation,
        open command line and run:
        $fitbit-ch
        $fitbit-dbup
        
        Scripts ask for input and provide different hints and help. If you are familiar with fitbit infrastructure, the
        instructions should be easy to follow.
        
        Note: In theory, it should be possible to run these scripts on Windows and Mac, but I haven't tested it there.
