Summary: LDAP Plugin for Zope2 PluggableAuthService (users and groups)

Description: This is a LDAP Plugin for the `Zope2 <http://zope2.zope.org>`_
        `Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PluggableAuthService>`_.
        
        It provides users and/or groups from an LDAP Directory. It works in a plain
        Zope2 even if it depends on
        `PlonePAS <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PlonePAS>`_.
        If `Plone <http://plone.org>`_ is installed an
        integration layer with a setup-profile and a plone-controlpanel page is
        available.
        
        ``pas.plugins.ldap`` is **not** releated to the old LDAPUserFolder/
        LDAPMultiPlugins and the packages stacked on top of it in any way.
        
        It is based on **node.ext.ldap**, an almost framework independent ldap stack.
        
        For now users and groups can't be added or deleted. But properties on both are
        read/write. See section *TODO*.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        Zope2
        -----
        
        Add to the instance section of your buildout::
        
            eggs =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
            zcml =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
        Run buildout. Restart Zope.
        
        Then got to your acl_users folder and add an LDAP-Plugin. Configure it using the
        settings form and activate its features with the ``activate`` tab.
        
        
        Plone
        -----
        
        Add to the instance section of your buildout::
        
            eggs =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
        Run buildout. Restart Plone.
        
        Then go to the Plone control-panel, select ``extensions`` and install the LDAP
        Plugin. A new LDAP Settings icon appear on the left. Click it and configure the
        plugin there.
        
        To use an own integration-profile, just add to the profiles
        ``metadata.xml`` file::
        
            ...
            <dependencies>
                ...
                <dependency>profile-pas.plugins.ldap.plonecontrolpanel:default</dependency>
            </dependencies>
            ...
        
        Additionally ldap settings can be exported and imported with ``portal_setup``.
        You can place the exported ``ldapsettings.xml`` in your integration profile, so
        it will be imported with your next install again. Attention: The **ldap-password
        is in there in plain text!**

        - add/delete users
        - add/delete groups
        - add flags for readonly groups and users
        - modes for only groups or only users from ldap
        
        Nice-to-Have
        ------------
        
        - group in group (depends on: node.ext.ldap: group.groups support)
        - roles from ldap
        
        Misc

        History
        =======
        
        1.3.2 (2014-09-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Small fixes in inspector.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.3.1 (2014-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix dependency versions.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.3.0 (2014-05-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Raise ``RuntimeError`` instead of ``KeyError`` when password change method
          couldn't locate the user in LDAP tree. Maybe it's a local user and
          ``Products.PlonePAS.pas.userSetPassword`` expects a ``RuntimeError`` to be
          raised in this case.
          [saily]
        
        
        1.2.0 (2014-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        - add property ``check_duplicates``. Adds ability to disable duplicates check
          for keys in ldap in order to avoid failure if ldap strcuture is not perfect.
        
        - Add new property to disable duplicate primary/secondary key checking
          in LDAP trees. This allows pas.plugins.ldap to read LDAP tree and ignore
          duplicated items instead of raising::
        
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: Key not unique: <key>='<value>'.
        
        
        1.1.0 (2014-03-03)
        ------------------
        
        - ldap errors dont block that much if ldap is not reachable,
          timeout blocked in past the whole zope. now default timeout for retry is
          300s - and some code cleanup
          [jensens]
        
        - use more modern base for testing
          [jensens]
        
        - Add URL example to widget help information how to specify an ldap uri.
          [saily]
        
        - Add new bootstrap v2
          [saily]
        
        
        1.0.2
        -----
        
        - sometimes ldap returns an empty string as portrait. take this as no portrait.
          [jensens, 2013-09-11]
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        - because of passwordreset problem we figured out that pas searchUsers calls
          plugins search with both login and name, which was passed to ugm and returned
          always an empty result
          [benniboy]
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - make it work.
        
        - base work done so far in ``bda.pasldap`` and ``bda.plone.ldap`` was merged.
