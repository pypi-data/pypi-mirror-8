            :target: http://travis-ci.org/#!/collective/pas.plugins.ldap
        
        This is a LDAP Plugin for the `Zope2 <http://zope2.zope.org>`_ `Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PluggableAuthService>`_.
        
        It provides users and/or groups from an LDAP Directory.
        It works in a plain Zope2 even if it depends on `PlonePAS <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PlonePAS>`_.
        If `Plone <http://plone.org>`_ is installed an integration layer with a setup-profile and a plone-controlpanel page is available.
        
        ``pas.plugins.ldap`` is **not** releated to the old LDAPUserFolder/ LDAPMultiPlugins and the packages (i.e. PloneLDAP) stacked on top of it in any way.
        
        It is based on **node.ext.ldap**, an almost framework independent ldap stack.
        
        For now users and groups can't be added or deleted. But properties on both are read/write.
        See section *TODO*.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        Zope2
        -----
        
        Add to the instance section of your buildout::
        
            eggs =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
            zcml =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
        Run buildout. Restart Zope.
        
        Then got to your acl_users folder and add an LDAP-Plugin.
        Configure it using the settings form and activate its features with the ``activate`` tab.
        
        
        Plone
        -----
        
        Add to the instance section of your buildout::
        
            eggs =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
        Run buildout. Restart Plone.
        
        Then go to the Plone control-panel, select ``extensions`` and install the LDAP Plugin.
        A new LDAP Settings icon appear on the left. Click it and configure the plugin there.
        
        To use an own integration-profile, just add to the profiles
        ``metadata.xml`` file::
        
            ...
            <dependencies>
                ...
                <dependency>profile-pas.plugins.ldap.plonecontrolpanel:default</dependency>
            </dependencies>
            ...
        
        Additionally ldap settings can be exported and imported with ``portal_setup``.
        You can place the exported ``ldapsettings.xml`` in your integration profile, so it will be imported with your next install again.
        Attention: The **ldap-password is in there in plain text!**
        
        
        Caching, Limitations and Future Optimizations
        =============================================
        
        By default the LDAP-queries are not cached.
        A must have for a production environment is having `memcached <http://memcached.org/>`_ server configured as LDAP query cache.
        Without this this module is slow (as any other module talking to LDAP will be).
        Cache at least for ~6 seconds, so a page load with all its resources is covered also in worst case.
        
        This package works fine for hundreds and also up to 3000 users (or more depending on your hardware).
        But then it slows down a bit. Primary problem is here the UGM tree used.
        It loads currently lots data - more than it need for a specific case - in its caching/working UGM tree.
        
        This is not that much a problem for small amount of users.
        There is room for future optimization in the underlying ``node.ext.ldap``.
        Contact us if you have resources in time or budget for this development task.
        
        The UGM tree is cached by default on the request, that means its built up every request from (cached) ldap queries.
        
        There is an alternative adapter available which will cache the ugm tree as volatile attribute on the persistent plugin.
        Volatile attributes are not persisted in the ZODB.
        If the plugin object vanishes from ZODB cache the atrribute is gone.
        The volatile plugin cache can be activated by loading its zcml with ``<include package="pas.plugins.ldap" file="cache_volatile.zcml"``.
        The caching time can be influenced by overriding the value in ``pas.plugins.ldap.cache.VOLATILE_CACHE_MAXAGE``.
        It defaults to 10 and its unit is seconds.
        
        Please keep in mind: Caching the UGM tree longer than one request means it could contain outdated data.
        
        If you plan a different implementation of UGM tree caching:
        Just provide your own adapter implementing ``pas.plugins.ldap.interfaces.IPluginCacheHandler``.

        History
        =======
        
        1.4.0 (2014-10-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Feature: Alternative volatile cache for UGM tree on plugin.
          [jensens]
        
        - overhaul test setup
          [jensens]
        
        - introduce pluggable caching mechanism on ugm-tree level, defaults to
          caching on request. Can be overruled by providing an adapter implementing
          ``pas.plugins.ldap.interfaces.IPluginCacheHandler``.
          [jensens]
        
        - log how long it takes to build up a users or groups tree.
          [jensens]
        
        1.3.2 (2014-09-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Small fixes in inspector.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.3.1 (2014-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix dependency versions.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.3.0 (2014-05-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Raise ``RuntimeError`` instead of ``KeyError`` when password change method
          couldn't locate the user in LDAP tree. Maybe it's a local user and
          ``Products.PlonePAS.pas.userSetPassword`` expects a ``RuntimeError`` to be
          raised in this case.
          [saily]
        
        
        1.2.0 (2014-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        - add property ``check_duplicates``. Adds ability to disable duplicates check
          for keys in ldap in order to avoid failure if ldap strcuture is not perfect.
        
        - Add new property to disable duplicate primary/secondary key checking
          in LDAP trees. This allows pas.plugins.ldap to read LDAP tree and ignore
          duplicated items instead of raising::
        
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: Key not unique: <key>='<value>'.
        
        
        1.1.0 (2014-03-03)
        ------------------
        
        - ldap errors dont block that much if ldap is not reachable,
          timeout blocked in past the whole zope. now default timeout for retry is
          300s - and some code cleanup
          [jensens]
        
        - use more modern base for testing
          [jensens]
        
        - Add URL example to widget help information how to specify an ldap uri.
          [saily]
        
        - Add new bootstrap v2
          [saily]
        
        
        1.0.2
        -----
        
        - sometimes ldap returns an empty string as portrait. take this as no portrait.
          [jensens, 2013-09-11]
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        - because of passwordreset problem we figured out that pas searchUsers calls
          plugins search with both login and name, which was passed to ugm and returned
          always an empty result
          [benniboy]
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - make it work.
        
        - base work done so far in ``bda.pasldap`` and ``bda.plone.ldap`` was merged.
