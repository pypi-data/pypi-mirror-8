Description: PlanOut is a framework for online field experimentation.
            PlanOut makes it easy to design both simple A/B tests and more complex
            experiments, including multi-factorial designs and within-subjects designs.
            It also includes advanced features, including built-in logging, experiment
            management, and serialization of experiments via a domain-specific language.
