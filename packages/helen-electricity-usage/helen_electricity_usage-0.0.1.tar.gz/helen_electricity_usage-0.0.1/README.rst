Helsingin Energia electricity usage scraper
===========================================

This small script fetches per-hour electricity usage from Helsingin Energia (Helen) website. This is unofficial implementation which may break at any time, if Helen changes their website or implements any additional validations.

Installation:

::

  pip install helen_electricity_usage

Usage:

::

  import helen_electricity_usage
  helen = helen_electricity_usage.Helen(username, password, metering_point_number)
  helen.login()
  print helen.get_date("20141225")

To obtain username and password, register using `web interface <https://www2.helen.fi/raportointi/>`_ (Flash and paper invoice is required). After registering and signing in, metering point number is available on the top-right corner.

Sample output (python dictionary):

::

  [ {
    "milestones" : [ ],
    "month" : 12,
    "value" : 0.22999,
    "year" : 2014,
    "day" : 25,
    "hour" : 0
  }, {
    "milestones" : [ ],
    "month" : 12,
    "value" : 0.15,
    "year" : 2014,
    "day" : 25,
    "hour" : 1
  }...
  ]

There is no way to check whether data for specific date is available. If data is not available, value will be 0.0.
