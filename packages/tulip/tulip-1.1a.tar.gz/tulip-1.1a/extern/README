This ``extern`` directory is a place for dependencies that cannot be easily met
by standard installation procedures of the dependency.  E.g., patch files and a
reference to the appropriate version should be given, or copies of a few
relevant headers may be copied here.

You should not install from ``extern`` unless you are instructed to do so.  In
particular, some things here may be dependencies of code under the ``contrib``
directory and thus are not dependencies of TuLiP per se.  Furthermore,
instructions herein may be incomplete or only intended to augment the
installation instructions of TuLiP or something under ``contrib``.

BEWARE THAT CODE HEREIN MAY BE UNDER A DIFFERENT LICENSE THAN THAT OF TULIP.
