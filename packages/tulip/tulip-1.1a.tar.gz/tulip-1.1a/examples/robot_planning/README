This directory contains a simple robot planning example that illustrates the
usage of the TuLiP toolbox.

discrete.py - discrete transition model
gr1.py - alternative system description directly using GRSpec
gr1_set.py - how to use an integer variable in gr1

mode switching (discrete state space):
    controlled_switching.py - both transitions and modes controlled
    environment_switching.py - env controls modes, sys controls transitions
    only_mode_controlled.py - sys controls modes, env controls transitions
    hybrid.py - (env, sys) control modes, sys controls transitions

continuous state space (discrete-time dynamics):
    continuous.py - continuous dynamics (with abstraction)
    pwa.py - modification to include pwa dynamics

In each of the examples, the task involves repeatedly visiting a cell,
responding to a parking signal, and avoiding an environmental obstacle.
