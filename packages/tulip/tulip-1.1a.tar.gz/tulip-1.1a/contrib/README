This ``contrib`` directory is a place for things that are not a part of TuLiP
per se but are still closely dependent and generally useful.  Their versions (if
given) are entirely independent of TuLiP.  Below is a summary of contents.

macports
  packaging via MacPorts <http://www.macports.org/>

readdstar.py, spin2dstar.py
  interfacing with LTL2DSTAR <http://ltl2dstar.de/>.  These may later be
  incorporated into TuLiP, in particular the tulip.spec subpackage.

AES
  specification generation for an electric power system.  Consult AES/README.

matlabsim
  files required to export controllers to Simulink blocks and a couple examples
  for reference.  Consult matlab/README.

nessainstall
  instructions for installing TuLiP on a big computer at Caltech but likely
  useful for similar settings, in particular in which there are old versions of
  system software, where only SSH access is available, and on a non-superuser
  account.  Consult nessainstall/README.md.

fmu
  routines to export a TuLiP controller as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU).
