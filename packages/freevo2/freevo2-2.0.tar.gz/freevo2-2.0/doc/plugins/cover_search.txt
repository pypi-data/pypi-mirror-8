This plugin will allow you to find album covers. At first, only
Amazon is supported. Someone could easily add allmusic.com support
which is more complete, but lacks a general interface like amazon's
web services.

You also need an Amazon developer key.


http://www.amazon.com/webservices

You need a Amazon-provided license key to use these services.
Follow the link above to get one.  These functions will look in
several places (in this order) for the license key:
- the "license_key" argument of each function
- the module-level LICENSE_KEY variable (call setLicense once to set it)
- an environment variable called AMAZON_LICENSE_KEY
- a file called ".amazonkey" in the current directory
- a file called "amazonkey.txt" in the current directory
- a file called ".amazonkey" in your home directory
- a file called "amazonkey.txt" in your home directory
- a file called ".amazonkey" in the same directory as amazon.py
- a file called "amazonkey.txt" in the same directory as amazon.py



activate it in your local_config.py:
plugin.activate('audio.coversearch')
