Fxd file
--------

Fxd (Freevo Xml Definition) files are xml based files containing
metadata for Freevo. A fxd file can contain skin informations,
playlists, contaner and urls for media data on the net.

There is no DTD for fxd files in general (and it's not even possible
without namespaces). Instead there are several Definitions for each
subtype of fxd files. The subtypes are inside the <freevo> tag:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<freevo>
  <subtag1/>
  <subtag2/>
</freevo>

You can fix as many subtags inside a fxd, it depends on the need and
if it makes sense to put it into one file. The next sections describe
the possible subtypes.

All subtypes except <skin> have the following optional arguments and
tags:

  <subtype title="foo">
    <cover-img>foo</cover-img>
    <info>
      <description>some text</description>
    </info>
  </subtype>

"title" is the name shown in the menu (each subtype should have one),
cover-img the image for the item. <info> can always contain a
<description> shown in the info are of the skin. Other tags inside
<info> are subtype specific.



Skin Definitions <skin>:
------------------------

The skin section inside a fxd file can be used to change the look of
the other items or the directory in freevo. E.g. putting <skin> inside
a folder.fxd for directories will change the skin for this
directory. If you put skin information in a fxd containing e.g. a
<container>, this skin will be used to display this container.

The skin section in this fxd file is identical with the normal skin
fxd files. But t doesn't make sense to define a whole new skin just
for one directory. Most of the time you want something small, like
changing the background picture.

Background pictures are handled best by the skin image.fxd. You can't
use this skin as your default skin, but you can inherit from this skin
in your fxd file.

For an example read the doc in share/skins/main/image.fxd



Movie information <movie>
-------------------------

The movie tag is to define whole movies. Movies can be have more than
one video file, special mplayer arguments, some variants and special
metadata like plot, summary and so on. The metadata can be created
using the imdb plugin or helper to get the data from IMDb.

The video tag is very complex, for a detailed description see
doc/freevo_XML_data.dtd.

You can also use the <movie> tag for making an item for url on the
net:

  <movie title="n-tv live">
    <video>
      <url id="p1">
        http://62.156.242.10/cgi-bin/redirNTV?user=ntv&amp;type=live&amp;name=nt00.rm
        <playlist/>
      </url>
    </video>
    <info>
      <description>n-tv live video stream</description>
    </info>
  </movie>


Audio information <audio>
-------------------------

Example:

  <audio title="Smoothjazz">
    <cover-img>foo.jpg</cover-img>
    <mplayer_options></mplayer_options>
    <player>xine</player>
    <playlist/>
    <reconnect/>
    <url>http://64.236.34.141:80/stream/1005</url>

    <info>
      <genre>JAZZ</genre>
      <description>A nice description</description>
    </info>

  </audio>
</freevo>

Everything except title and url is optional. If <player> is set,
this player will be used (possible xine or mplayer). The tag
<playlist/> signals that this url is a playlist (mplayer needs that).
<reconnect/> signals that the player should reconnect when the
connection stopps.


Playlists <playlist>
--------------------

Why a new playlist format? We wanted a way to make very simple
playlists, like this directory without listing all items in it. 

  <playlist title="foo" random="1|0" repeat="1|0">
    <cover-img>foo.jpg</cover-img>
    <files>
      <directory recursive="1|0">path</directory>
      <file>filename</file>
    </files>
    <info>
      <description>A nice description</description>
    </info>
  </playlist>

Again all arguments and tags are optional, but you shoudl have at
least one <file> or <directory> in <files> to have a playlist
here. 'random="1"' plays the playlist always in randommode,
'repeat="1"' will repeat the playing until the user stops.

<files> is a very easy way to add items to the playlist. The simple
form is to use <file> to add a specific file, but you can also use
<directory> to add all files in the directory with one line. Adding
'recursive="1"' all files in this directory and all subdirectories
will be taken.



Slideshows <slideshow>
----------------------

Slideshows are similar to playlists, except they are for images only
and can contain a background music which is again similar to a
playlist.

  <slideshow title="foo" random="1|0" repeat="1|0">
    <cover-img>foo.jpg</cover-img>
    <background-music random="1|0">
      <directory recursive="1|0">path</directory>
      <file>filename</file>
    </background-music>
    <files>
      <directory recursive="1|0" duration="10">path</directory>
      <file duration="0">filename</file>
    </files>
    <info>
      <description>A nice description</description>
    </info>
  </slideshow>

The only thing different from playlist is the duration argument for
file or directory. 


Container <container>
---------------------

A <container> is only a (like the word says) container for other
items. It can contain all media fxd subtypes (== everything except
<skin>), even <container> again.

As example take a look at share/fxd/webradio.fxd. It is a container
with container in it, containing <audio> items. Selecting a container
item inside Freevo will show a menu looking similar to a directory
menu.
