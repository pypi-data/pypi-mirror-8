Tap the camera or file picker buttons to start adding images to the gallery.\n\nWhen you have images in the gallery, you can tap over them to see each image, and download/export it to your device. You can also press the share button to upload it to imgur, or delete the picture.\n\n<strong>// LIVE CAMERA VIEW //</strong>\n\nIf using the camera you'll be asked for access to the camera. Depending on your configuration, you might even be able to select which camera to use (front or back in mobiles, or an specific webcam in desktop platforms).\n\nOnce you allow access to the camera, a live feed with special effects applied on the fly will show up and you'll be able to capture the frames you like most by tapping and holding down the screen or the camera shutter button.\n\nYou can change between effects by swiping right or left, or pressing the left/right arrow buttons.\n\n\n... and it has <strong>VIDEO</strong>!!\n\nYou can tap the switch on the bottom to toggle between camera and video modes. When in video mode you can capture up to two seconds of animated GIF frames.\n\nTo start capturing, hold down as if you were going to take a picture, and the app will start capturing frames until either you reach two seconds of length, or stop holding down. You can add more frames by holding down again, up to the two seconds limit, or press the 'OK' tick sign.\n\nWhen you reach the limit or press the tick sign, the app will start processing the captured frames to build the animated GIF. Meanwhile you won't be able to capture frames or take pictures. When the rendering is completed, the GIF will be added to your gallery.\n\n\n\n<strong>// PROCESSING EXISTING IMAGES //</strong>\n\nIf picking an existing image, you will be shown standard interfaces for picking a picture from your device. Once you select one you can start changing between effects just as before, by swiping left or right, or pressing the arrow buttons.\n\nWhen you like an image, hold down to add it to the gallery.\n\n\n<strong>// SOURCE CODE / CONTRIBUTE //</strong>\n\n<strong>rtcamera</strong> is an open source app. You can look at the code, see how it's made, learn from it and even help to make it better!\n\nView the <a href=\"http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/0aa1296d409829216e163418ee60dbd0e2f72aaad8765bf20cb6a244009908e5/http%3A//github.com/sole/rtcamera\" rel=\"nofollow\">source code</a>, and make sure to read the <a href=\"http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/62d910dd31e3cbe85e31903f08c617465f1e56a067f74a2a7afd4d4e7be98332/https%3A//github.com/sole/rtcamera/blob/master/docs/Walkthrough.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">developer walkthrough</a> if you want to contribute to the project development.", "default_locale": "en-US", "tags": [], "price": null, "previews": [{"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111314.png?modified=1377167100", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111314.png?modified=1377167100", "id": "111314", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/111314/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111385.png?modified=1377167100", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111385.png?modified=1377167100", "id": "111385", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/111385/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/111/111386.png?modified=1377167100", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/111/111386.png?modified=1377167100", "id": "111386", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/111386/"}], "payment_account": null, "categories": ["entertainment", "photo-video"], "supported_locales": [], "price_locale": null, "name": "rtcamera", "versions": {"0.1.2": "/api/v1/apps/versions/1483935/"}, "device_types": ["desktop", "android-mobile", "android-tablet", "firefoxos"], "payment_required": false, "weekly_downloads": null, "upsell": false, "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/app/461045/"}
