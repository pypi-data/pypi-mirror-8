Both for the desktop and mobile devices.</strong>\n\nWeb-based modeling, simulation and optimization of logistics systems (e. g. warehouses, assembly lines, production, factory layouts) based on HTML5, WebGL, memcached, parallel algorithms. SAP integration available.\n\n<strong>Efficient logistics requires</strong>\n<ul><li>for day to day management: powerful planning- and management-tools based on smart algorithms </li><li>in a tactical / strategic scope: easy to use and powerful modeling, 3D-simulation and optimization tools</li></ul>\nTo meet these demands, W2MO was developed.\nInternet easy: W2MO is a web-based modeling, 3D-simulation and optimization framework under the new Internet technology HTML5, WebGL and Canvas. With W2MO anyone can create on its web browser models of logistics systems quickly and easily, and exchange this with colleagues, customers, suppliers and business partners. Large groups of users (e. g. in global acting company) can co-operate in a completely new way and thereby create not previously achievable productivity and efficiency gains. W2MO supports not only the knowledge exchange but in particular the optimization of logistics systems. Layout alternatives or alternative strategies can be changed quickly and jointly evaluated. Manufacturer of automation and conveyor technology can integrate their solutions directly into the virtual logistics of their customer. Customers can compare alternative solutions. Consultants can analyze layouts remotely and present suggestions online. Changes can be quantified directly.\n\nWorkforce planning is integrated and focused on logistics and production. The demand calculation is precise and based on MTM and the REAL orders and activities. Full integration of all kind of mobile devices.\n\n3D-simulation and animation is provided using WebGL. Indeed W2MO is the only tools which offers that advanced visualization in the web-browser. Users may create their own 3D-objects and load them into W2MO. Very realistic views are supported.\n\nRevolutionary modeling: Conventional modeling and simulation tools are mainly process-oriented. This approach is too complicated and expensive for logistics.  W2MO creates processes automatically out of the layout. The user can model the layout with a graphic editor, fast and easy. Manual work - which is an important issue for logistics - is included by using standard times. In logistics standard times like e. g. MTM, Refa are a simple and efficient approach for modeling the required manual work.\n\nSmart optimization: W2MO includes advanced algorithms for various fields of application in logistics. In a purely operational use they are integrated as a \"black box\" in e. g. a WMS or ERP system. For design, configuration and tuning, they can be operated within the framework of W2MO. This allows to fine tune changes before applied in practice!\n\nThe solution is highly scalable. W2MO can be used for small logistics systems. W2MO can be used for large logistics systems with very large data sets. Special filters and compression technologies have been integrated into the solution. W2MO can be applied to any browser-enabled devices. This may be a desktop PC - but also most smartphones can be used. The application on the smartphone creates new possibilities when it comes to the modeling of a logistics center. Users can carry the application with them when they walk through the logistics center.\n\nAs registered user there is a training course and extensive help available.", "default_locale": "en-US", "tags": [], "price": null, "previews": [{"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/69/69979.png?modified=1337280761", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/69/69979.png?modified=1337280761", "id": "69979", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/69979/"}], "payment_account": null, "categories": ["business", "productivity"], "supported_locales": [], "price_locale": null, "name": "W2MO\u00ae", "versions": {"3.8": "/api/v1/apps/versions/1330614/"}, "device_types": ["desktop", "android-mobile", "android-tablet", "firefoxos"], "payment_required": false, "weekly_downloads": null, "upsell": false, "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/app/371865/"}
