Looks beautiful, runs amazingly smooth taking advantage of hardware acceleration\n\nFeatures:\n* Current Direction your device is facing (North, South, East, West)\n* Degrees of direction\n* Current GPS coordinates\n* Level Tool (overlays the compass)\n* Display the angle at which you are tilting your device (Upwards, Downwards, Left/Right Tilted Upwards)\n* Visualization of device tilt, can be used for leveling\n\nFuture improvements we are considering:\n* Display your GPS location: City, Country\n* Show dedicated Level Tool (for portrait &amp; landscape)\n* Tap to keep a current direction and show a visual of the deviation while in motion\n* Calibration notification/assistant\n\nIMPORTANT:\nYou may need to wiggle, shake, and rotate your phone from time to time to recalibrate the sensors, we are considering making a prompt for device sensor calibration. And the accuracy may vary from device to device, and remember to keep away from magnetic fields.\n\nA few important notes regarding the colors and white background:\nWe put considerable thought in the background and the colors used in Compass+, the compass dial is a flat orange color in homage to FirefoxOS, regarding the background color and why we chose white; some may point out that the white screen may drain more battery, nevertheless this is not the case; using a black background/backlight will not save battery, simply put there is a backlight at the back of your screen that is constantly outputting light and the black pixels are simply blocking the light not actually turning it off. This is not the case for AMOLED screens, but given the budget friendly nature of FirefoxOS devices the choice was to pick the optimal color for the intended and planned devices.\n\nAnd don't forget to try out our other awesome apps for FirefoxOS:\nCleanCalc: <a href=\"http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/94ba34744503d871ccf3dfcd28f97bb8fd152e4772c1f233487253c2b6f8fb6f/https%3A//marketplace.firefox.com/app/cleancalc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/cleancalc</a>\nTip Calculator: <a href=\"http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/8cbd6bbb4dfd264a6359a53eb3d6b024feb7427c238c9d520f9df4d9654a7600/https%3A//marketplace.firefox.com/app/tip-calculator-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/tip-calculator-1</a>\nThePhoneDatabase: <a href=\"http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/8a46698907484a91ff6a53548d01e48c745968c285f35f9daf3376159509155f/https%3A//marketplace.firefox.com/app/the-phone-database\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/the-phone-database</a>", "default_locale": "en-US", "tags": [], "price": null, "previews": [{"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/118/118819.png?modified=1385302750", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/118/118819.png?modified=1385302750", "id": "118819", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/118819/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/118/118820.png?modified=1385302750", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/118/118820.png?modified=1385302750", "id": "118820", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/118820/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/118/118821.png?modified=1385302750", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/118/118821.png?modified=1385302750", "id": "118821", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/118821/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/118/118822.png?modified=1385302750", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/118/118822.png?modified=1385302750", "id": "118822", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/118822/"}], "payment_account": null, "categories": ["utilities", "maps-navigation"], "supported_locales": ["es", "it"], "price_locale": null, "name": "Compass +", "versions": {"1.0": "/api/v1/apps/versions/1502014/"}, "device_types": ["firefoxos"], "payment_required": false, "weekly_downloads": null, "upsell": false, "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/app/473398/"}
