Description: PatchTools
        ==========
        
        Do you need to apply GIT patches to a different source version than the one on
        which they were developed? PatchTools can greatly accelerate the process of determining
        whether the patches are needed by the new source, and how to fix them if they are needed.

        - Detects missing files in your source tree
        - Detects file that are incorrectly present in your source tree
        - Detects lines are not at the line numbers specified in the patches
        - Can find significant lines that are elsewhere in the same file
        - Issues a readable report of errors found
