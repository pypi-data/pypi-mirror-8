Welcome to Stetl
================

Stetl, Streaming ETL, is an open source (GNU GPL) toolkit for the transformation (ETL)
of geospatial data.  Stetl is based on existing ETL tools like GDAL/OGR and
XSLT. Stetl processing is driven from a configuration (.ini) file.
Stetl is written in Python and in particular suited for processing GML.

This is the documentation of the Stetl toolkit.
The code is on GitHub: https://github.com/justb4/stetl.

See an `introductory Stetl presentation at Slideshare <http://www.slideshare.net/justb4/stetl-foss4g20131024v1>`_.
