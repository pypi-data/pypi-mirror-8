This project would not be possible without the great work of Frank Warmerdam and other
GDAL/OGR developers (http://gdal.org).

Plus the people that brought Python, PostGIS (like Paul Ramsey), lxml and the libs
like GEOS, Proj, libxml2 and libxslt.

We are mainly standing on the shoulders of these giants.
