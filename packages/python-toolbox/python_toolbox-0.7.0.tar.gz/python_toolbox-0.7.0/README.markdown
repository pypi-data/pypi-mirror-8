# What is the Python Toolbox? #

The Python Toolbox is a collection of Python tools for various tasks. It
contains:

 - `python_toolbox.caching`: Tools for caching functions, class instances and
   properties.
 
 - `python_toolbox.cute_iter_tools`: Tools for manipulating iterables. Adds
   useful functions not found in Python's built-in `itertools`.
 
 - `python_toolbox.context_management`: Pimping up your context managers.
 
 - `python_toolbox.emitting`: A publisher-subscriber framework that doesn't
   abuse strings.
   
 - And many, *many* more! The Python Toolbox contains **100+** useful little
   tools.

# Not backward-compatible yet #

Please keep in mind that Python Toolbox is still in alpha stage, and that backward compatibility would *not* be maintained in this phase. 


# Roadmap #

## Present ##

Python Toolbox is at version 0.7.0, which is an alpha release. It's being used in production every day, but backward compatibility isn't guaranteed yet.

## Next tasks ##

Adding more useful tools.

## Future ##

Make a 1.0 release and start maintaining backward compatibility.

# Python versions #
 
The Python Toolbox supports Python versions 2.7 and 3.3+.

It's tested on both CPython and PyPy 2.1.


# Tests #

Test can be run by running the `_test_python_toolbox.py` script that's
installed automatically with the Python Toolbox.

When `python_toolbox` isn't installed, you may run `nosetests` at the repo root
to run the tests.
