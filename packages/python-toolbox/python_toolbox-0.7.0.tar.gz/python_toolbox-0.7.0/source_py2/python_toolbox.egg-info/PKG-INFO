Description: 
        The Python Toolbox is a collection of Python tools for various tasks. It
        contains:
        
         - ``python_toolbox.caching``: Tools for caching functions, class instances and
            properties.
         
         - ``python_toolbox.cute_iter_tools``: Tools for manipulating iterables. Adds
            useful functions not found in Python's built-in ``itertools``.
         
         - ``python_toolbox.context_management``: Pimping up your context managers.
         
         - ``python_toolbox.emitting``: A publisher-subscriber framework that doesn't
            abuse strings.
           
         - And many, *many* more! The Python Toolbox contains **100+** useful
           little tools.
        
           
        Please keep in mind that Python Toolbox is still in alpha stage, and that
        backward compatibility would *not* be maintained in this phase.

        Tests
        =====
        
        Test can be run by running the ``_test_python_toolbox.py`` script that's
        installed automatically with the Python Toolbox.
        
        When ``python_toolbox`` isn't installed, you may run ``nosetests`` at the repo
        root to run the tests.
