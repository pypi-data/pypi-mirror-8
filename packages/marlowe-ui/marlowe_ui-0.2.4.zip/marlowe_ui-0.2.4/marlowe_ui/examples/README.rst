- *orig/test_xx.dat* original sample file
- *test_xx/xx_assaved.dat* output file by mui.py, which should be tested and compatible *orig/test_xx.dat*
- *test_xx/xx_assaved.json* output file by mui.py. The .json file can be loaded on mui.py and generates *xx_assaved.dat* directly.
- *test_xx/xx_patched.dat* modified from *xx_assaved.dat* in order to obtain same output as one from *orig/test_xx.dat* . If *xx_patched.dat* does not exist, *xx_assaved.dat* is confirmed to be compatible with its original example.

The differences between *xx_assaved* and *xx_patched* are following. The list indicates the insufficient points of current version of mui.py
