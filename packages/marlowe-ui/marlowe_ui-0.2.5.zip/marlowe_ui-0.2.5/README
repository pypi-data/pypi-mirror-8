Usage and current limitation
=============================

Fill parameters as you like and push [Save] button.

[Save (& run)]
---------------

Save widget contents for both marlowe input data (usually having .dat extension) file and .json format.
The .json file can be loaded by [load .json] button.

When parameter file is saved correctly, then a dialog to run marlowe program will pop-up.

[Load .json]
-------------

Currently, mui.py cannot load marlowe data format yet, but allows to load data file in JSON format created by above [Save (& run)] command.

[Validate]
----------

[validate] button tests widget contents (if a content of widget is not valid the widget turns red)
This validation routine also runs before [Save (& run)] action.

.. note::

  Validation does not run automatically. The user should push
  [Validate] button explicitly to confirm the modification on GUI 
  is correct or not.

Other Buttons
-------------

[Set Example] [Dump to Console] [Clear] buttons still remains for debugging.
