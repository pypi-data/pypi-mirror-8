Description: 
        Python's Fraction data type is an excellent way to do exact money
        calculations and largely beats Decimal in terms of simplicity,
        accuracy and safety.  Clearly not in terms of speed, though.
        
        This is an adaptation of the original module (as included in
        CPython 3.4) that is compiled and optimised with Cython into a
        fast, native extension module.
        
        Compared to the standard library 'fractions' module in Py2.7 and
        Py3.4, 'quicktions' is currently about 10x faster.
