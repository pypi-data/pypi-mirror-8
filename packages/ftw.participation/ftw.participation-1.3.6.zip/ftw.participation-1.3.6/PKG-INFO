Description: ftw.participation
        =================
        
        
        With `ftw.participation` users can invite other users to a participate in
        a area (e.g. Workspace) of a Plone installation.
        
        A privileges user is able to invite another person by going to the invite view
        and entering the e-mail address of the other person. The person receives a email
        with a link to the Plone installation where he / she can log in with a existing
        user or create a new one. On the invitations view he / she can now accept or
        deny the invitation. When the invitation is accepted the user gets the configured
        privileges on the context where he / she is invited.
        
        The invitations are stored in a special container in the annotations of the
        plone site root.
        
        Each invitation has its own unique id, which is used in the URL sent to the
        invited person. When the plone site is accessed using this link the invitation
        is assigned to the users session. That's why he can accept the invitation although
        he may be logged in with another user ID.
        
        
        Activating
        ----------
        
        First you need to import the generic setup profile, which adds some actions, a
        browser layer and other stuff.
        
        For activating the participation on a folderish content object give it the Interface
        `ftw.participation.interfaces.IParticipationSupport` which enables the participation
        on this context. This adds a new action "Manage participants" on this context and
        you can invite other people.
        
        A invited person will receive a e-mail containing a link to the platform,
        containing the invitation id. After registering / logging in there is a new action
        "My invitations" in the user menu, where the user can accept or reject the
        invitation.
        
        
        Using Quotas
        ------------
        
        Providing the interface `ftw.participation.interfaces.IParticipationQuotaSupport`
        adds a "Maximum amount of participaants" field to the schema which defines how
        many other users can be invited.
        
        When a quota is set the user can only invite that amount of user to this context. There
        is a validator on the invitation form which ensures that the quota will not be crossed.
        
        When setting the quota to `5` it is only possible to invite 4 other users because the
        first participant is the owner, which usually already exists. Inviting the same user
        multiple times counts also multiple times, but the invitor is able to retract the
        invitation on the "My invitations" view.
        
        
        Customizing email messages
        --------------------------
        
        If a person is invitied to a context he gets a e-mail notification. If this person accepts
        or rejects the invitation the inviter is notified by e-mail. Those e-mails are multipart
        emails containing a HTML part and a plaintext fallback part.
        
        The messages may be customized eather by overwriting the translations or by customizing the
        mail templates in `ftw.participation.browser`.
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        - Just add ``ftw.participation`` to the eggs in your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ftw.participation
        
        
        - Install the generic setup profile.

        - BugFix: Pass email_from as string, not as email.header instance.
          This fixes sending emails with an Exchange.
          [mathias.leimgruber]
        
        - Do not show invite link, if internal user and email invitation is disabled.
          [mathias.leimgruber]
        
        
        1.3.5 (2014-09-15)

        ------------------
        
        - Participants: fix table layout for read-only users.
          [jone]
        
        - Participants: hide users without roles.
          This can happen when inheriting the Owner, because inherited Owner
          roles are removed.
          [jone]
        
        
        1.3.3 (2014-08-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix some grammar mistakes in translations.
          [tschanzt]
        
        - Do not encode from address only name.
          [tschanzt]
        
        1.3.2 (2014-06-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Show inherited roles on participants tab.
          [mathias.leimgruber]
        
        - Make sure the participation-tab has no manipulation control elements
          if IParticipationSupport is not active.
          [mathias.leimgruber]
        
        - The participants-tab now also works without IParticipationSupport (read only).
          [mathias.leimgruber]
        
        
        1.3.1 (2014-03-14)
        ------------------
        
        - When allow_multiple_roles is disabled, the Reader role should
          not be added to the selected role as default role, since it
          does not make sense to have multiple roles in this case.
          [jone]
        
        
        1.3.0 (2014-03-14)

        - Fix view-registrations if accessing e.g. on subsites.

          [tschanzt]
        
        
        1.2.0 (2014-02-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Make participants view available for normal users.
          The view removes the management UI (invite / remove participants) when
          the user has not enough privileges.
          The link to the participants view is still protected, a link can be placed
          on integration level when needed.
