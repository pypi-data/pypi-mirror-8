Django Smart Proxy is based heavily on Django HTTP Proxy
(https://bitbucket.org/yvandermeer/django-http-proxy/), which was
originally written by Yuri van der Meer.

Yuri thanks Will Larson for providing the initial inspiration and original
source code:

The Django Smart Proxy application, in its current iteration,
was adapted and written by Matt Caldwell <matt.caldwell@gmail.com> and
is maintained by Celerity IT, LLC <opensource@celerity.com> and the generous
and talented Open Source community (http://opensource.org/).
