Ideas / TODO

The most pressing issues can be found in the issue tracker on Github.

* Make Pyro support listening to multiple network interfaces at the same time (and returning the correct URI from the daemon. Name server is harder...)
* automatic callback handling if you pass a callable to the server
* add multiprocess server (forking?) based on multiprocessing?
* object activation / object registration strategies: instance_per_call, instance_per_connection, shared_instance (let the daemon instantiate your object's class instead of user code)
* persistent Name Server (store namespace in a database on disk) use sqlite because it needs multithreading/transactions
* Pyro-over-SSH (not SSL/TLS) using Paramiko?
