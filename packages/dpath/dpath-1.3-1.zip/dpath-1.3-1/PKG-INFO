Description: 
        DPath is a library that allows you to access dictionaries similar to using find over a filesystem. The proper documentation is maintained on GitHub: https://github.com/akesterson/dpath-python
        
        Version 1.3 introduces the get() and values() functions which are useful for quickly extracting values, and only values, without accompanying path information.
        
        Version 1.2 introduces a number of fixes against 1.1:
        
            * Support for python 3
        
            * List handling has been completely redone. Various builds of 1.1 had fundamentally broken list handling. 1.2 handles list insertions, deletions, and searches as expected.
        
            * The backend path library has been improved to include type information with each path component, so the issue of lists mysteriously being transformed into dictionaries will no longer happen
        
            * The merge function's filtering has been fixed; before, it was broken, as directory nodes were merged in before filtering leaf nodes, making the filters essentially useless.
        
            * The unit test suite has been expanded.
        
            * Support for python 3
        
        Many thanks to our community contributors for their patches.
