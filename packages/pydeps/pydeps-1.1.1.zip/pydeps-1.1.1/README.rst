Python module dependency visualization. This package installs the ``pydeps``
command, and normal usage will be to use it from the command line. To install::

    pip install pydeps

To create graphs you need to install Graphviz_ (make sure the ``dot``
command is on your path).

.. Note:: to display the resulting `.svg` files, it currently calls
          ``firefox foo.svg``.  This is a bug/limitation that will
          hopefully be fixed soon'ish. I would suggest creating a
          script file called ``firefox`` that redirects to your
          favorite viewer if you can't use ``firefox``. Pull requests
          are very welcome.

This is the result of running ``pydeps`` on itself (``pydeps --show pydeps``):

``pydeps`` also contains an Erd≈ës-like scoring function (a.k.a. Bacon
number, from Six degrees of Kevin Bacon
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) that lets
you filter out modules that are more than a given number of 'hops'
away from the module you're interested in.  This is useful for finding
the interface a module has to the rest of the world.


To find pydeps' interface to the Python stdlib (less some very common modules).

::

    pydeps pydeps --show --max-bacon 2 --pylib -x os re types _* enum

.. image:: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/94882440/pydeps-pylib.svg

``--max-bacon 2`` gives the modules that are at most 2 hops away, and modules
that belong together have similar colors.  Compare that to the output
without the ``--max-bacon 2`` filter:

``pydeps`` can detect and display cycles with the ``--show-cycles`` parameter.
This will _only_ display the cycles, and for big libraries it is not a
particularly fast operation.  Given a folder with the following contents (this
uses yaml to define a directory structure, like in the tests)::

        relimp:
            - __init__.py
            - a.py: |
                from . import b
            - b.py: |
                from . import a

``pydeps relimp --show-cycles`` displays:

An attempt has been made to keep the intermediate formats readable,
eg. the output from ``pydeps --show-deps ..`` looks like this::

    ...
    "pydeps.mf27": {
        "imported_by": [
            "__main__",
            "pydeps.py2depgraph"
        ],
        "kind": "imp.PY_SOURCE",
        "name": "pydeps.mf27",
        "path": "pydeps\\mf27.py"
    },
    "pydeps.py2depgraph": {
        "imported_by": [
            "__main__",
            "pydeps.pydeps"
        ],
        "imports": [
            "pydeps.depgraph",
            "pydeps.mf27"
        ],
        "kind": "imp.PY_SOURCE",
        "name": "pydeps.py2depgraph",
        "path": "pydeps\\py2depgraph.py"
    }, ...

Usage::

    usage: pydeps-script.py [-h] [-v] [-o file] [-T FORMAT] [--show] [--show-deps]
                            [--show-dot] [--debug] [--pylib] [--pylib-all]
                            [-x EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]]
                            fname

    positional arguments:
      fname                 filename

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose         be more verbose (-vv, -vvv for more verbosity)
      -o file               write output to 'file'
      -T FORMAT             output format (svg|png)
      --show                call external program to display graph
      --show-deps           show output of dependency analysis
      --show-dot            show output of dot conversion
      --debug               turn on all the show and verbose options
      --pylib               include python std lib modules
      --pylib-all           include python all std lib modules (incl. C modules)
      -x EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...], --exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]
                            input files to skip

You can of course import ``pydeps`` from Python (look in the
``tests/test_relative_imports.py`` file for examples.
