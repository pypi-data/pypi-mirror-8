"""Common functions between reprozip and reprounzip.

This module contains functions that are specific to the reprozip software and
its data formats, but that are shared between the reprozip and reprounzip
packages. Because the packages can be installed separately, these functions are
in a separate module which is duplicated between the packages.

As long as these are small in number, they are not worth putting in a separate
package that reprozip and reprounzip would both depend on.
