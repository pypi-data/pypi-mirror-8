        ``firapria`` is a lightweight library to extract pollution indices from
        Airparif website for IDF (France).
        
        Install
        -------
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip install firapria
        
        Since version 0.1.1, ``firapria`` supports both Python 2.x and 3.x.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block::
        
            from firapria.pollution import get_indices
            indices = get_indices()
        
        It returns three integers, for yesterday’s, today’s and tomorrow’s indices. It
        might return only two integers sometimes, it’s when no prevision is available
        for tomorrow’s indice, usually before 11 AM.
        
        The library also include a simple CLI of the same name:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            $ firapria
            Pollution:
                Yesterday: 42
                Today: 40
                Tomorrow: 40
        
        Before 0.1.1
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``get_indices`` was introduced in version 0.1.1. Before that one, another API
        was used. It’s still supported, but the new API is easier. ::
        
            from firapria.pollution import PollutionFetcher
            indices = PollutionFetcher().indices()
