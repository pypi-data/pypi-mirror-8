By contrast,\x0athe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\x0ashare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\x0asoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\x0aGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\x0aany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\x0ayour programs, too.\x0a\x0a  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\x0aprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\x0ahave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\x0athem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\x0awant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\x0afree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\x0a\x0a  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\x0athese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\x0acertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\x0ayou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\x0a\x0a  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\x0agratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\x0afreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\x0aor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\x0aknow their rights.\x0a\x0a  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\x0a(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\x0agiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\x0a\x0a  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\x0athat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\x0aauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\x0achanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\x0aauthors of previous versions.\x0a\x0a  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\x0amodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\x0acan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\x0aprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\x0apattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\x0ause, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\x0ahave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\x0aproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\x0astand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\x0aof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\x0a\x0a  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\x0aStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\x0asoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\x0aavoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\x0amake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\x0apatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\x0a\x0a  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\x0amodification follow.\x0a\x0a                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\x0a\x0a  0. Definitions.\x0a\x0a  \x22This License\x22 refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\x0a\x0a  \x22Copyright\x22 also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\x0aworks, such as semiconductor masks.\x0a\x0a  \x22The Program\x22 refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\x0aLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \x22you\x22.  \x22Licensees\x22 and\x0a\x22recipients\x22 may be individuals or organizations.\x0a\x0a  To \x22modify\x22 a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\x0ain a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\x0aexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \x22modified version\x22 of the\x0aearlier work or a work \x22based on\x22 the earlier work.\x0a\x0a  A \x22covered work\x22 means either the unmodified Program or a work based\x0aon the Program.\x0a\x0a  To \x22propagate\x22 a work means to do anything with it that, without\x0apermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\x0ainfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\x0acomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\x0adistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\x0apublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\x0a\x0a  To \x22convey\x22 a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\x0aparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\x0aa computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\x0a\x0a  An interactive user interface displays \x22Appropriate Legal Notices\x22\x0ato the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\x0afeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\x0atells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\x0aextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\x0awork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\x0athe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\x0amenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\x0a\x0a  1. Source Code.\x0a\x0a  The \x22source code\x22 for a work means the preferred form of the work\x0afor making modifications to it.  \x22Object code\x22 means any non-source\x0aform of a work.\x0a\x0a  A \x22Standard Interface\x22 means an interface that either is an official\x0astandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\x0ainterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\x0ais widely used among developers working in that language.\x0a\x0a  The \x22System Libraries\x22 of an executable work include anything, other\x0athan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\x0apackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\x0aComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\x0aMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\x0aimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\x0a\x22Major Component\x22, in this context, means a major essential component\x0a(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\x0a(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\x0aproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\x0a\x0a  The \x22Corresponding Source\x22 for a work in object code form means all\x0athe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\x0awork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\x0acontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\x0aSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\x0aprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\x0awhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\x0aincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\x0athe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\x0alinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\x0asuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\x0asubprograms and other parts of the work.\x0a\x0a  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\x0acan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\x0aSource.\x0a\x0a  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\x0asame work.\x0a\x0a  2. Basic Permissions.\x0a\x0a  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\x0acopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\x0aconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\x0apermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\x0acovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\x0acontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\x0arights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\x0a\x0a  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\x0aconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\x0ain force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\x0aof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\x0awith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\x0athe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\x0anot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\x0afor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\x0aand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\x0ayour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\x0a\x0a  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\x0athe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\x0amakes it unnecessary.\x0a\x0a  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\x0a\x0a  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\x0ameasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\x0a11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\x0asimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\x0ameasures.\x0a\x0a  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\x0acircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\x0ais effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\x0athe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\x0amodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\x0ausers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\x0atechnological measures.\x0a\x0a  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\x0a\x0a  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\x0areceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\x0aappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\x0akeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\x0anon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\x0akeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\x0arecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\x0a\x0a  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\x0aand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\x0a\x0a  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\x0a\x0a  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\x0aproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\x0aterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\x0a\x0a    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\x0a    it, and giving a relevant date.\x0a\x0a    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\x0a    released under this License and any conditions added under section\x0a    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\x0a    \x22keep intact all notices\x22.\x0a\x0a    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\x0a    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\x0a    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\x0a    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\x0a    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\x0a    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\x0a    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\x0a\x0a    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\x0a    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\x0a    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\x0a    work need not make them do so.\x0a\x0a  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\x0aworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\x0aand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\x0ain or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\x0a\x22aggregate\x22 if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\x0aused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\x0abeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\x0ain an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\x0aparts of the aggregate.\x0a\x0a  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\x0a\x0a  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\x0aof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\x0amachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\x0ain one of these ways:\x0a\x0a    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\x0a    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\x0a    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\x0a    customarily used for software interchange.\x0a\x0a    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\x0a    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\x0a    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\x0a    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\x0a    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\x0a    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\x0a    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\x0a    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\x0a    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\x0a    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\x0a    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\x0a\x0a    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\x0a    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\x0a    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\x0a    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\x0a    with subsection 6b.\x0a\x0a    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\x0a    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\x0a    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\x0a    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\x0a    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\x0a    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\x0a    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\x0a    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\x0a    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\x0a    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\x0a    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\x0a    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\x0a\x0a    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\x0a    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\x0a    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\x0a    charge under subsection 6d.\x0a\x0a  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\x0afrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\x0aincluded in conveying the object code work.\x0a\x0a  A \x22User Product\x22 is either (1) a \x22consumer product\x22, which means any\x0atangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\x0aor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\x0ainto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\x0adoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\x0aproduct received by a particular user, \x22normally used\x22 refers to a\x0atypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\x0aof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\x0aactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\x0ais a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\x0acommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\x0athe only significant mode of use of the product.\x0a\x0a  \x22Installation Information\x22 for a User Product means any methods,\x0aprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\x0aand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\x0aa modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\x0asuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\x0acode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\x0amodification has been made.\x0a\x0a  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\x0aspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\x0apart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\x0aUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\x0afixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\x0aCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\x0aby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\x0aif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\x0amodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\x0abeen installed in ROM).\x0a\x0a  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\x0arequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\x0afor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\x0athe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\x0anetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\x0aadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\x0aprotocols for communication across the network.\x0a\x0a  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\x0ain accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\x0adocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\x0asource code form), and must require no special password or key for\x0aunpacking, reading or copying.\x0a\x0a  7. Additional Terms.\x0a\x0a  \x22Additional permissions\x22 are terms that supplement the terms of this\x0aLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\x0aAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\x0abe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\x0athat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\x0aapply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\x0aunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\x0athis License without regard to the additional permissions.\x0a\x0a  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\x0aremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\x0ait.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\x0aremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\x0aadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\x0afor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\x0a\x0a  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\x0aadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\x0athat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\x0a\x0a    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\x0a    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\x0a\x0a    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\x0a    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\x0a    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\x0a\x0a    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\x0a    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\x0a    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\x0a\x0a    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\x0a    authors of the material; or\x0a\x0a    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\x0a    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\x0a\x0a    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\x0a    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\x0a    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\x0a    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\x0a    those licensors and authors.\x0a\x0a  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \x22further\x0arestrictions\x22 within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\x0areceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\x0agoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\x0arestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\x0aa further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\x0aLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\x0aof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\x0anot survive such relicensing or conveying.\x0a\x0a  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\x0amust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\x0aadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\x0awhere to find the applicable terms.\x0a\x0a  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\x0aform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\x0athe above requirements apply either way.\x0a\x0a  8. Termination.\x0a\x0a  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\x0aprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\x0amodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\x0athis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\x0aparagraph of section 11).\x0a\x0a  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\x0alicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\x0aprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\x0afinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\x0aholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\x0aprior to 60 days after the cessation.\x0a\x0a  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\x0areinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\x0aviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\x0areceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\x0acopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\x0ayour receipt of the notice.\x0a\x0a  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\x0alicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\x0athis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\x0areinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\x0amaterial under section 10.\x0a\x0a  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\x0a\x0a  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\x0arun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\x0aoccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\x0ato receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\x0anothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\x0amodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\x0anot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\x0acovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\x0a\x0a  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\x0a\x0a  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\x0areceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\x0apropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\x0afor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\x0a\x0a  An \x22entity transaction\x22 is a transaction transferring control of an\x0aorganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\x0aorganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\x0awork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\x0atransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\x0alicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\x0agive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\x0aCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\x0athe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\x0a\x0a  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\x0arights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\x0anot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\x0arights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\x0a(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\x0aany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\x0asale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\x0a\x0a  11. Patents.\x0a\x0a  A \x22contributor\x22 is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\x0aLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\x0awork thus licensed is called the contributor's \x22contributor version\x22.\x0a\x0a  A contributor's \x22essential patent claims\x22 are all patent claims\x0aowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\x0ahereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\x0aby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\x0abut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\x0aconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\x0apurposes of this definition, \x22control\x22 includes the right to grant\x0apatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\x0athis License.\x0a\x0a  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\x0apatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\x0amake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\x0apropagate the contents of its contributor version.\x0a\x0a  In the following three paragraphs, a \x22patent license\x22 is any express\x0aagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\x0a(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\x0asue for patent infringement).  To \x22grant\x22 such a patent license to a\x0aparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\x0apatent against the party.\x0a\x0a  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\x0aand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\x0ato copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\x0apublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\x0athen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\x0aavailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\x0apatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\x0aconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\x0alicense to downstream recipients.  \x22Knowingly relying\x22 means you have\x0aactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\x0acovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\x0ain a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\x0acountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\x0a\x0a  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\x0aarrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\x0acovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\x0areceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\x0aor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\x0ayou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\x0awork and works based on it.\x0a\x0a  A patent license is \x22discriminatory\x22 if it does not include within\x0athe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\x0aconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\x0aspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\x0awork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\x0ain the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\x0ato the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\x0athe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\x0aparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\x0apatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\x0aconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\x0afor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\x0acontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\x0aor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\x0a\x0a  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\x0aany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\x0aotherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\x0a\x0a  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\x0a\x0a  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\x0aotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\x0aexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\x0acovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\x0aLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\x0anot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\x0ato collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\x0athe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\x0aLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\x0a\x0a  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\x0a\x0a  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\x0apermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\x0aunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\x0acombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\x0aLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\x0abut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\x0asection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\x0acombination as such.\x0a\x0a  14. Revised Versions of this License.\x0a\x0a  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\x0athe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\x0abe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\x0aaddress new problems or concerns.\x0a\x0a  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\x0aProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\x0aPublic License \x22or any later version\x22 applies to it, you have the\x0aoption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\x0aversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\x0aFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\x0aGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\x0aby the Free Software Foundation.\x0a\x0a  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\x0aversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\x0apublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\x0ato choose that version for the Program.\x0a\x0a  Later license versions may give you additional or different\x0apermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\x0aauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\x0alater version.\x0a\x0a  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\x0a\x0a  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\x0aAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\x0aHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \x22AS IS\x22 WITHOUT WARRANTY\x0aOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\x0aTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\x0aPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\x0aIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\x0aALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\x0a\x0a  16. Limitation of Liability.\x0a\x0a  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\x0aWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\x0aTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\x0aGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\x0aUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\x0aDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\x0aPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\x0aEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\x0aSUCH DAMAGES.\x0a\x0a  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\x0a\x0a  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\x0aabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\x0areviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\x0aan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\x0aProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\x0acopy of the Program in return for a fee.\x0a\x0a                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\x0a\x0a            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\x0a\x0a  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\x0apossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\x0afree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\x0a\x0a  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\x0ato attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\x0astate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\x0athe \x22copyright\x22 line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\x0a\x0a    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\x0a    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\x0a\x0a    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\x0a    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\x0a    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\x0a    (at your option) any later version.\x0a\x0a    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\x0a    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\x0a    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\x0a    GNU General Public License for more details.\x0a\x0a    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\x0a    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\x0a\x0aAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\x0a\x0a  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\x0anotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\x0a\x0a    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\x0a    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\x0a    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\x0a    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\x0a\x0aThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\x0aparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\x0amight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \x22about box\x22.\x0a\x0a  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\x0aif any, to sign a \x22copyright disclaimer\x22 for the program, if necessary.\x0aFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\x0a<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\x0a\x0a  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\x0ainto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\x0amay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\x0athe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\x0aPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\x0a<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\x0a"
