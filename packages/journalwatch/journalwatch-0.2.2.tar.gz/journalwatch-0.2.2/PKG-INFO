Description: journalwatch
        ============
        
        journalwatch is a tool which can find error messages in the systemd journal.
        
        It is similiar to tools like
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/[logwatch] or
        http://logcheck.org/[logcheck] except it's much more KISS and
        only works with the systemd
        http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/journalctl.html[journal]. It works by defining
        patterns to match all log lines which are not interesting, and then prints all
        log lines not matching those patterns (or sends them by mail).
        
        When you start it the first time, it'll write the default pattern and config to
        `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/journalwatch` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is your home if
        unset). Details on how to configure journalwatch are available in these files.
