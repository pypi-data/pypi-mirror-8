journalwatch
============

journalwatch is a tool which can find error messages in the systemd journal.

It is similiar to tools like
http://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/[logwatch] or
http://logcheck.org/[logcheck] except it's much more KISS and
only works with the systemd
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/journalctl.html[journal]. It works by defining
patterns to match all log lines which are not interesting, and then prints all
log lines not matching those patterns (or sends them by mail).

When you start it the first time, it'll write the default pattern and config to
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/journalwatch` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is your home if
unset). Details on how to configure journalwatch are available in these files.

Dependencies
------------

- Python 3 (tested with 3.3 and 3.4, should work with >= 3.2)
- `systemd` python module
- A working `sendmail`/MTA (http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/[msmtp] is easy to set
up)
