        =======
        
        This is a sample Python 3 project from which to start new projects.
        It demonstrates an initial project structure.
        
        Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
        usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
        a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
        may be appropriate.
        
        TODO: generate this file from README.md.
