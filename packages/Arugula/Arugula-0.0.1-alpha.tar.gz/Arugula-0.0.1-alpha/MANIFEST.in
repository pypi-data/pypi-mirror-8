# This file specifies what non-default files to include in a
# source distribution (i.e. a *.tar.gz file generated by running
# `python setup.py sdist`.)

# The following files get included automatically, so there is no need
# to include them explicitly:
#
#   MANIFEST.in
#   setup.py
#

include .gitignore
include LICENSE
include README.md
recursive-include docs *.md
