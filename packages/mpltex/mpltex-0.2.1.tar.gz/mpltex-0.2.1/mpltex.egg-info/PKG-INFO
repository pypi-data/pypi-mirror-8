Description: mpltex
        ======
        
        ``mpltex`` is a python package for producing publication quality images using ``matplotlib``.
        Inspired by `Olga Botvinnik <http://olgabotvinnik.com/>`_'s python package `prettyplotlib <https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib>`_.
        
        The internal ``matplotlib`` color cycle is replaced by ColorBrewer Set1 scale which looks less saturated and more pleasing to eyes.
        For more information on ColorBrewer, see `a flash-based interactive map <http://colorbrewer2.org/>`_ and `a quick visual reference to all ColorBrewer scales <http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5577023>`_.
        
        ``mpltex`` also enable cycle line styles and a selected set of line markers.
        Hollow markers are supported.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        1. Install
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install mpltex
        
        **Required Packages**
        
        -  `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_. Can be installed via
           ``pip install matplotlib``.
        -  `brewer2mpl <https://github.com/jiffyclub/brewer2mpl>`_. Can be
           installed via ``pip install brewer2mpl``.
        
        2. Usage
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        Just add one of ``mpltex`` decorators before your plot functions.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import mpltex
        
            @mpltex.acs_decorator
            def your_plot():
                # plot images by matplotlib ...
        
                # Save the image. Give a file name without extension.
                # You can also save figure outside your_plot if you like.
                fig.save_fig('/path/to/save/fig/figname')
        
            # Then use your_plot in a normal way.
            your_plot()
        
        And it will produce images suitable for publishing in American Chemical Society (ACS).
        
        ``mpltex`` also contains several helper functions to faciliate production of specific type of images.
        Following codes will produce a set of line arts with cycled line styles and line markers with the help of ``mpltex.linestyle_generator`` function.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            import mpltex
        
            @mpltex.acs_decorator
            def your_plot():
                # generate data x and y
                fig, ax = plt.subplots(111)
                for i in range(number_of_lines):
                    # The default line style is iterating over
                    # color, line, and marker with hollow types.
                    linestyles = mpltex.linestyle_generator()
                    ax.plot(x[i], y[i], label=str(i), **linestyles.next())
        
                ax.locator_params(nbins=5)  # limit the number of major ticks
                ax.legend(loc='best')  # show legend in a best location
                fig.tight_layout(pad=0.1)  # make layout as tight as possible
                fig.savefig('/path/to/save/fig/figname')
        
        **Available Decorators**
        
        * ``mpltex.acs_decorator``: output EPS images for publishing in ACS.
        * ``mpltex.presentation_decorator``: output PDF images for presentation slides (Keynote).
        * ``mpltex.web_decorator``: output PNG images for web pages.
