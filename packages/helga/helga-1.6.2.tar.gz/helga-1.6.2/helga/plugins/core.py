    to do so. Subclasses must provide one class-level attribute:

    - **pattern**: either a valid regex pattern string, or a callable

    If the match pattern is a callable, it must accept a single string argument,
    which will be the IRC message to check, and it must return a value that can be
    evaluated as either True or False via bool(). Good practice here is to
    return the list of strings that were matched or found, but this is not
    required.

    method that accepts five arguments:

    - **client**: an instance of :class:`helga.comm.Client`
    - **channel**: the channel on which the message was received
    - **nick**: the current nick of the message sender
    - **message**: the message string itself

    """
    A decorator for creating simple commands where subclassing the ``Command``
    plugin type may be overkill. This is generally the easiest way to create helga
    commands. However, decorated functions must adhere to accepting six arguments:

    - **client**: an instance of :class:`helga.comm.Client`
    - **channel**: the channel on which the message was received
    - **nick**: the current nick of the message sender
    - **message**: the message string itself
    - **command**: the parsed command, which is either the preferred command or a command alias
    - **args**: a list of strings, space delimited, that follow the command

    The decorated function must return a string or None. If the return value is an empty string or
    None, then no response will be sent over IRC. A simple command example::

        @command('foo', aliases=('bar', 'baz'))
        def foo(client, channel, nick, message, command, args):
            return '{0} said {1}'.format(nick, command)

        <sduncan> helga foo
        <helga> sduncan said foo
        <sduncan> helga bar
        <helga> sduncan said bar

    :param aliases: list of additional command names
    :param help: a simple help/usage string
    :param priority: priority weight to give this plugin. Must be an integer value, a higher value
                     meaning a higher priority (default 50)
    :param shlex: Enable using shlex.split() for arg string parsing. This will be the default
                  behavior in a future version.

    A decorator for creating simple regex matches where subclassing the ``Match``
    plugin type may be overkill. This is generally the easiest way to create helga
    match plugins. However, decorated functions must adhere to accepting five arguments:

    - **client**: an instance of :class:`helga.comm.Client`

      otherwise it will be the return value of ``re.findall``.

    The decorated function must return a string or None. If the return value is an empty string or
    None, then no response will be sent over IRC. A simple command example::

        @match('foo')

    :param pattern: regex string or callable that accepts a single argument and returns a value
                    that can be evaluated for truthiness
    :param priority: priority weight to give this plugin. Must be an integer value, a higher value
