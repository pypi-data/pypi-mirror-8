Asynchronous ZIP File Creation from Plone Content or Webservices
================================================================

.. contents::


This is a basic module aiming to create ZIP files asynchronous. Even if it has
some basic built in data-extractors, it is not meant as a out-of-the-box
package, but for integrators and addon-product authors.

Creating ZIP files in a request-response cycle may take a lot of time. With
this package a zip job info is queued into a AMQP-Server (such as  RabbitMQ).

The ZIP file is created in a worker instance. After the file was created an
event is fired. With it i.e. an e-mail notification can be send out.

The state of the creation (pending, processing, finished) and the timestamps
(queued, started, finished) are shared between worker and instance.

The worker instance gets a jobinfo (dict) with global key ``settings`` (dict)
and a list of fileinfos (list of dicts). Each fileinfo has at least a valid
UUID of an content item. For each fileinfo in the list one file will be
created. It adapts the content with the given UUID with
``collective.azipfele.interfaces import IZipContentExtractor`` using ZCA.
If fileinfo contains an ``extractor`` (string) it uses a named adapter.

The ``IZipContentExtractor`` takes on call the fileinfo and gloabl settings.
it is expected to return a tuple of filename and the data to be stored in the
zip with the filename. The returned filename can be a relative path as well.


Installation
============

Just depend in your buildout on the egg ``collective.azipfele`. ZCML is
loaded automagically with z3c.autoinclude.

Install ``Async Zip File Support`` as an addon in Plone control-panel or
portal_setup or depend on ``profile-collective.asynczip:default`` in your
profiles ``metadata.xml``.

This package is written for Plone 4.3 or later.
