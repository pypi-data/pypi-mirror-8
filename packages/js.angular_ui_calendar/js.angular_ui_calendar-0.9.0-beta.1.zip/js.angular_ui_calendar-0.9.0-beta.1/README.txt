js.angular_ui_calendar
**********************

Introduction
============

This library packages `angular-ui-calendar`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`angular-ui-calendar`: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-calendar

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.angular_ui_calendar``) are published to some URL.
