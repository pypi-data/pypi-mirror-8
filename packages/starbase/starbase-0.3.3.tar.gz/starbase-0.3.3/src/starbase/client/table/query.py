This would be the code base for filtering in `starbase`. The `fetch_all_rows` method would be then cleaned
and would just return all rows (perhaps paginated results?)

Table instance.

>>> t = c.table('table1')

Using the QuerySet
---------------------

Query by row key, using regex. The "pk" prefix would mean we actually want to filter on row key. Otherwise,
we would consider it to be a start of "column_family__column_qualifier" pair. If may of course vary from
filter to filter, but the unified interface would work like that.

>>> results = t.filter(pk__eq__regex="^row_1.+").fetch()

Query by column qualifier, using equal.

>>> results = t.filter(column_1__qualifier_1__eq="john.doe@example.com").fetch()

When fireing one after another, joined by "AND". In the example below, both statements shall be satisfied.

>>> results = t.filter(pk__eq__regex="^row_1.+")
>>> results = results.filter(column_1__qualifier_1__eq="john.doe@example.com")

Finally, executing the query.

>>> results = results.fetch()

Using the `Q`
---------------------
Mainly for "OR" joins.

In the example below filters are joined by "OR". One of the two statements shall be satisfied.

>>> q1 = Q(pk__eq__regex="^row_1.+")
>>> q2 = Q(column_1__qualifier_1__eq="john.doe@example.com")
>>> results = t.filter(q1 | q2)

Finally, executing the query.

>>> results = results.fetch()

        The following syntax examples would be supported (see the comments at the very top of the module).
