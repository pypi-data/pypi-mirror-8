SlackBuilds.org (sbo) FAQ(15): 
Slackware current is not supported, but as a general rule, the scripts
should work on it as well.

Rworkman's (rlw) repository use dependencies where displayed in central site 
'http://rlworkman.net/pkgs/' and only those. Unfortunately there is no fixed reference
dependencies file PACKAGES.TXT.

Slackers.it (slackr) repository must be used only from Slackware64 current users.
Also find in some packages will not show package description when you run the command
'slpkg -p slackr <package>' and this is because there is not constant reference to the
description of the file 'PACKAGES.TXT' as in other repositories. Some packages reference
dependencies not included in the repository. This can be checked if you run the command
'slpkg -t slackr <package>'. (Example: noticed that the package 'digikam' indicate 
dependence 'ffmpeg' but that is not available from the repository itself).

Slackonly (slonly) repository contains no dependencies on file PACKAGES.TXT and this makes
it difficult to automatically resolve dependencies and in the file PACKAGES.TXT and some
lines with 'PACKAGE NAME:' there is no package so 'slpkg' can not find package.
Users with Slackware x86_64 will use this repository should establish from the beginning 
the list of packages with the command 'slpkg re-create' to be updated with new packages 
and it's because the repository has not 'ChangeLog.txt' file.

Studioware (studio), Alien's ktown (ktown), Alien's multilib (multi), Slacke E17 and E18
repository has no reference dependencies.

Slackel.gr (slackl) repository must be used only from Slackware current users and has the
same peculiarities in the repository 'slackr'.
