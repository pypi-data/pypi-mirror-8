        Installation:
        =============
        
        The installation under Python 2.7 for the release package is as follows:
        
        1.- Download and install Maltego (Community Edition is free)
        
        2.- Run Maltego. It is not necessary to create an account.
        
        3.- We recommend to install the app under a specific folder to let
        Maltego find the transforms without further configuration. The
        installation under a Linux system with a folder '/var/i3visio' (in
        Windows, it should be 'C:/i3visio') already created is as follows:
        ``# Navigate to the folder cd /var/i3visio git clone http://github.com/i3visio/maltfy cd maltfy-master sudo python setup.py build sudo python setup.py install``
        or
        ``# Navigate to the folder cd /var/i3visio wget http://github.com/i3visio/maltfy/archive/master.zip unzip maltfy-master.zip cd master sudo python setup.py build sudo python setup.py install``
        Superuser privileges are required so as to complete the installation.
        Afterwards, the module will be importable from any python code. You can
        check this by typing: ``python -c "import maltfy"`` If no error is
        displayed, the installation would have been performed correctly.
        
        4.- Import the i3visio configuration from the
        maltfy-master/maltfy/i3visio-configuration.
        
        5.- Update the Working directory of the loaded transforms if necessary
        to match the appropriate directory. By default it can be found under: -
        Linux: /var/i3visio/maltfy-master/maltfy - Windows:
        c:/i3visio/maltfy-master/maltfy
        
Platform: UNKNOWN
