        Homekeeper
        ==========
        NOTE: The format for homekeeper configuration has changed; this change is not
        backwards compatible with the old version.
        
        This project helps me organize and version my dotfiles across multiple
        computers.  It is useful to keep these dotfiles in sync so I don't get confused.
        You may or may not find it useful.
        
        My dotfiles repository is located here if you'd like to take a look:
        
            https://github.com/retiman/dotfiles
        
        Homekeeper will read a `$HOME/.homekeeper.json` file for configuration, or create
        one if it doesn't already exist.  The default configuration looks like this:
        
            {
                "base": "/home/$USER/dotfiles/base",
                "directory": "/home/$USER/dotfiles/$HOST",
                "override": true,
                "excludes": [
                    ".git",
                    ".gitignore",
                    "LICENSE",
                    "README.md"
                ]
            }
        
        Homekeeper will not symlink any file in the `excludes` array in the
        configuration.  The default is to exclude the `.gitignore` and `.git` files
        but you can change this if you want.
        
        Homekeeper will symlink files in the base directory first, then override those
        symlinks with files in your normal dotfiles directory.  This can be useful if
        you have different configurations for different machines.
        
        You may have homekeeper generate this file by running `homekeeper init` in the
        directory where you store your dotfiles.
        
        Once homekeeper knows where your dotfiles live, it will remove the dotfile in
        your home directory, and symlink it from your dotfiles directory.  For example,
        if you have a `.bash_profile` in `~/dotfiles`, then your home directory will
        contain:
        
            .bash_profile -> /home/$USER/dotfiles/.bash_profile
        
        NOTE: HOMEKEEPER WILL REMOVE THE ORIGINAL FILE ONCE YOU TELL IT TO SYMLINK.
        
        Make sure you back it up or are having homekeeper track the file you want to
        symlink first.
        
        Multiple Computers
        ==================
        If you have multiple computers or VMs you are working with, you may wish to
        create directories named after each machine, and possibly a base directory for
        dotfiles common across all machines and do not change.
        
        More Documentation
        ==================
        There isn't any.  I don't think anybody will use this except me.
