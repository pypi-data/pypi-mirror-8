        Homekeeper
        ==========
        NOTE: The format for homekeeper configuration has changed; this change is not
        backwards compatible with the old version.
        
        This project helps organize and dotfiles across multiple (even across multiple
        computers).  It does so by marking a directory as your 'dotfiles directory' and
        then symlinking those files into your HOME directory.
        
        In the event that you use multiple computers and would like dotfiles to be
        shared, you can specify a 'base' dotfiles directory and have host specific
        dotfiles override them.
        
        One benefit of doing this is you can easily version your dotfiles directory with
        the revision control system of your choice.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        My dotfiles repository is located here if you'd like to take a look:
        
            https://github.com/retiman/dotfiles
        
        How It Works
        ============
        
        Homekeeper will read a `$HOME/.homekeeper.json` file for configuration, or create
        one if it doesn't already exist.  The default configuration looks like this:
        
            {
                "base": "/home/$USER/dotfiles/base",
                "directory": "/home/$USER/dotfiles/$HOST",
                "override": true,
                "excludes": [
                    ".git",
                    ".gitignore"
                ]
            }
        
        Homekeeper will not symlink any file in the `excludes` array in the
        configuration.
        
        Homekeeper will symlink files in the base directory first, then override those
        symlinks with files in your normal dotfiles directory.  This can be useful if
        you have different configurations for different machines.
        
        You may have homekeeper generate this file by running `homekeeper init` in the
        directory where you store your dotfiles.
        
        Once homekeeper knows where your dotfiles live, it will remove the dotfile in
        your home directory, and symlink it from your dotfiles directory.  For example,
        if you have a `.bash_profile` in `~/dotfiles`, then your home directory will
        contain:
        
            .bash_profile -> /home/$USER/dotfiles/.bash_profile
        
        NOTE: HOMEKEEPER WILL REMOVE THE ORIGINAL FILE ONCE YOU TELL IT TO SYMLINK.
        
        Make sure you back it up or are having homekeeper track the file you want to
        symlink first.

        ==================
        There isn't any.  I don't think anybody will use this except me.
