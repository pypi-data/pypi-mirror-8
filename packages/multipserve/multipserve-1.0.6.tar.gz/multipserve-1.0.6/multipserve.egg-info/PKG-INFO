Description: Multi Pserve
        ============
        
        |Build Status| Little script for you use in many pservers Pyramid
        
        How to
        ------
        
        Install
        
        ::
        
            pip install multipserve
        
        First, you can use the python script in your root directory for start
        servers
        
        ::
        
            mpserve --apps app1 app2 app3 app4
        
        *app’s are directory of applications*
        
        After, multipserve creates pid and log file with name of each
        application
        
        ::
        
            app1.pid app1.log
        
        For killing, you can use this:
        
        ::
        
            mpserve (-k|--kill) app1 app2 app3
        
        If app killed successfully
        
        ::
        
            kill app1 with pid 41235
        
        To do
        -----
        
        Multi Pserve works but not how I think … I want it to has a web page or
        even at the terminal(which I think unlikely/not functional) show the
        logs of active servers.
        
        Look `issues`_ for more details.
        
        1. All application now are loaded in –reload mode
        2. *multipserve* creates a .log and a .pid files for each application
        3. *multipserve* now works with arguments –apps or –kill
