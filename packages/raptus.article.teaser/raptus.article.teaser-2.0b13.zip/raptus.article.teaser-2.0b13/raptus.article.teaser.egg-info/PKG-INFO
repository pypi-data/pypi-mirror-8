Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        raptus.article.teaser provides support for adding a teaser image on article.
        
        The following features for raptus.article are provided by this package:
        
        Fields
        ------
            * Provides an image field for the articles.
        
        Components
        ----------
            * raptus.article.teaser.full
            * raptus.article.teaser.right
            * raptus.article.teaser.left
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
            * collective.flowplayer
            * Products.ContentTypeValidator
            * raptus.article.core
            * plone.app.imaging
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        JS Picture Galleries
        ````````````````````
        
        By default this component opens images in a `Products.jsImagePopups`_ gallery.
        
        To use `collective.prettyphoto`_ install the package and set the property
        ``teaser_rel_attribute`` to ``prettyPhoto``.
        
        .. _`Products.jsImagePopups`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.jsImagePopups
        
        .. _`collective.prettyphoto`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.prettyphoto
        
        
        plone.app.imaging
        `````````````````
        
        To use plone.app.imaging scales simply set the corresponding properties to the name
        if the image scale.
        
        If present, those will overrule the width and height settings.
        
        available properties:
        
        * teaser_thumb_scale
        * teaser_left_scale
        * teaser_full_scale
        * teaser_popup_scale
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install raptus.article.teaser into your Plone instance, locate the file
        buildout.cfg in the root of your Plone instance directory on the file system,
        and open it in a text editor.
        
        Add the actual raptus.article.teaser add-on to the "eggs" section of
        buildout.cfg. Look for the section that looks like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
        
        This section might have additional lines if you have other add-ons already
        installed. Just add the raptus.article.teaser on a separate line, like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
                raptus.article.teaser
        
        Note that you have to run buildout like this::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Then go to the "Add-ons" control panel in Plone as an administrator, and
        install or reinstall the "raptus.article.default" product.
        
        Note that if you do not use the raptus.article.default package you have to
        include the zcml of raptus.article.teaser either by adding it
        to the zcml list in your buildout or by including it in another package's
        configure.zcml.
        
        Plone 3 compatibility
        ---------------------
        
        This packages requires plone.app.imaging which requires two pins in buildout
        when using Plone 3, which there are::
        
            Products.Archetypes = 1.5.16
            plone.scale = 1.2
