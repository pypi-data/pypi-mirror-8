        Installation
        ============
        
        The stable releases are uploaded to `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org>`_, so
        you can install and upgrade using ``pip``::
        
          pip install omni
        
        Alternatively, you can install development versions —at your own risk—
        directly from the Git repository::
        
          pip install -e git://github.com/aperezdc/omni
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The documetation for OMNI is available at:
        
          http://omni.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
        .. important:: Note that the documentation is work-in-progress and
                       for the moment it is lacking a lot of content.
