Description: 
            ontv is a utility that helps you keep track of what you are looking at
            right now.
        
            It is based of data from thetvdb.com which requires an account and an api
            key to access, but contains information about most existing tv shows and
            their air date.
        
            My source of focus was to fast create a usable application that tracks the
            tv shows I am currently watching.
