Description: 
        SimX is a library for developing parallel, discrete-event simulations
        in Python. SimX is written in C++ and Python.
        
        SimX provides the simulation developer with core functionality such as
        - event queueing
        - entity management
        - domain parititioning
        - synchronization and message passing.
        
        SimX also supports process oriented simulations. Parallel simulations are
        implemented using distributed memory and message passing.
        
        SimX has been written to be flexible enough to suit a variety of
        application domains that use discrete-event simulations for modeling,
        and has been designed to allow applications to scale from single
        processor workstations to high-performance clusters.
