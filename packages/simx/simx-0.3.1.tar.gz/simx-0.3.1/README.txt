SimX is a library for developing parallel, discrete-event simulations
in Python. SimX is written in C++ and Python.

SimX provides the simulation developer with core functionality such as
- event queueing
- entity management
- domain parititioning
- synchronization and message passing.

SimX also supports process oriented simulations. Parallel simulations are
implemented using distributed memory and message passing.

SimX has been written to be flexible enough to suit a variety of
application domains that use discrete-event simulations for modeling,
and has been designed to allow applications to scale from single
processor workstations to high-performance clusters.
