        Lipid-converter is a tool for manipulations of lipid bilayers
        in molecular dynamics simulations. You might find
        it most useful for tasks involving transformations and also conversions. 
        Typical usage often looks like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from lipid_converter import transform
            from lipid_converter import convert
