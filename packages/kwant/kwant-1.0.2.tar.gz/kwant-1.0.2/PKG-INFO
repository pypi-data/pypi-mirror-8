Description: Kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport calculations. It
        exposes the natural concepts of the theory of quantum transport (lattices,
        symmetries, electrodes, orbital/spin/electron-hole degrees of freedom) in a
        simple and transparent way. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of
        transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), dispersion
        relations, modes, wave functions, various Greenâ€™s functions, and
        out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other computations involving tight-binding
        Hamiltonians can be implemented easily.
