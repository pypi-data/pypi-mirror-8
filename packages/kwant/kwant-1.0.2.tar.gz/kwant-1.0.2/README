Kwant is a Python package for numerical quantum transport calculations. It
exposes the natural concepts of the theory of quantum transport (lattices,
symmetries, electrodes, orbital/spin/electron-hole degrees of freedom) in a
simple and transparent way. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of
transport properties (conductance, noise, scattering matrix), dispersion
relations, modes, wave functions, various Greenâ€™s functions, and
out-of-equilibrium local quantities. Other computations involving tight-binding
Hamiltonians can be implemented easily.
