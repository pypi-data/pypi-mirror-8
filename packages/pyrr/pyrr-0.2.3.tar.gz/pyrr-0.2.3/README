Pyrr
====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adamlwgriffiths/Pyrr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adamlwgriffiths/Pyrr)

Provides 3D mathematical functions using the power of NumPy.

Features:
  * Matrix (3x3, 4x4)
  * Quaternion
  * Vector (3D, 4D)
  * Plane
  * Ray
  * Line / Line Segment (3D)
  * Rectangle (2D)
  * Axis Aligned Bounding Box (AABB / AAMBB)
  * Geometric collision / intersection testing

Documentation
-------------

[View Pyrr's documentation online](https://pyrr.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).


Examples
--------

Maintain a rotation (quaternion) and translation (vector) and convert to a matrix

    from pyrr import quaternion, matrix44, vector3
    import numpy as np

    orientation = quaternion.create(dtype=np.float32)        
    translation = vector3.create(dtype=np.float32)
    scale = vector3.create(1,1,1,dtype=np.float32)

    # translate along X by 1
    translation += [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    # rotate about Y by pi/2
    rotation = quaternion.create_from_y_rotation(math.pi / 2.0, dtype=np.float32)
    orientation = quaternion.cross(rotation, orientation)

    # create a matrix
    # start our matrix off using the scale
    matrix = matrix44.create_from_scale(scale, dtype=np.float32)

    # apply our orientation
    orientation = matrix44.create_from_quaternion(orientation)
    matrix = matrix44.multiply(matrix, orientation)

    # apply our translation
    translation = matrix44.create_from_translation(translation)
    matrix = matrix44.multiply(matrix, translation)
