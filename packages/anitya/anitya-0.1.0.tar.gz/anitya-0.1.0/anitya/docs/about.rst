Anitya
======

Anitya is a project version monitoring system.

Every-day Anitya checks if there is a new version available and broadcast the
new versions found via a message bus: `fedmsg <http://www.fedmsg.com/>`_.

Anyone with an OpenID account can register a new application on Anitya. To
do so, all you need is the project name and its home page, the combination
of both must be unique. In order to retrieve the new version, you can specify
a backend for the project hosting. More information below.


Backends
--------

The backend of a project tells Anitya how to retrieve the versions of the
project.

The backends available are:

* ``cpan.py`` for perl projects hosted on `CPAN <http://www.cpan.org/>`_
* ``debian.py`` for projects hosted on the
  `Debian ftp <http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/>`_
* ``drupal6.py`` for Drupal6 modules hosted on
  `drupal.org <http://drupal.org/project/>`_
* ``drupal7.py`` for Drupal7 modules hosted on
  `drupal.org <http://drupal.org/project/>`_
* ``folder.py`` for projects whose release archives are provided in a folder
  basic apache folder or modified one.
* ``freshmeat.py`` for projects hosted on
  `freshmeat.net <http://freshmeat.net/>`_ / `freecode.com <http://freecode.com/>`_
* ``github.py`` for projects hosted on `github.com <http://github.com/>`_
* ``gnome.py`` for projects hosted on
  `download.gnome.org <https://download.gnome.org/sources/>`_
* ``gnu.py`` for projects hosted on `gnu.org <https://www.gnu.org/software/>`_
* ``google.py`` for projects hosted on
  `code.google.com <https://code.google.com/>`_
* ``hackage.py`` for projects hosted on
  `hackage.haskell.org <http://hackage.haskell.org/>`_
* ``launchpad.py`` for projects hosted on
  `launchpad.net <https://launchpad.net/>`_
* ``npmjs.py`` for projects hosted on `npmjs.org <https://www.npmjs.org/>`_
* ``pear.py`` for projects hosted on
  `pear.php.net <http://pear.php.net/>`_
* ``pecl.py`` for projects hosted on
  `pecl.php.net <http://pecl.php.net/>`_
* ``pypi.py`` for projects hosted on
  `pypi.python.org <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_
* ``rubygems.py`` for projects hosted on
  `rubygems.org <http://rubygems.org/>`_
* ``sourceforge.py`` for projects hosted on
  `sourceforge.net <http://sourceforge.net/>`_

If your project cannot be used with any of these backend you can always try
the ``custom`` backend.

* ``custom.py`` for projects who require a more flexible way of finding their
  version.


The custom backend requires two arguments:

* ``version_url`` the url of the page where the versions information can be
  found, for example for `banshee <http://banshee.fm/>`_
  that would be `their download page <http://banshee.fm/download/>`_

* ``regex`` a regular expression to find the releases on the ``version_url``
  page.

.. note:: In most cases, you can set the ``regex`` to `DEFAULT` which will
          make anitya use its default regular expression:

          ::

            <package name>[-_]([^-/_\s]+?)(?i)(?:[-_](?:src|source))?\.(?:tar|t[bglx]z|tbz2|zip)
