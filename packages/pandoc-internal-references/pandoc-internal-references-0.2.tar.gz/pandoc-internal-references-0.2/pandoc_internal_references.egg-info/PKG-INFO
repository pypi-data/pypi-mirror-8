Description: This pandoc filter implements an internal reference manager for pandoc,
        making it possible to reference images and sections that have attribute
        tags.
        
        Supported output formats are latex, html, html5 and markdown. The
        markdown output format can be used to convert
        markdown-with-figure-attributes into currently valid pandoc markdown.
        
        This allows you to write something like this:
        
        .. code:: markdown
        
            Look at #fig:thing.
        
            ![some caption](image.png){#fig:thing}
        
        and get this markdown:
        
        .. code:: markdown
        
            Look at [Figure 1](#fig:thing).
        
            <div id='#fig:thing'>
            ![Figure 1: some caption](image.png)
        
            </div>
        
        this latex:
        
        .. code:: latex
        
            Look at \autoref{fig:thing}.
        
            \begin{figure}[htbp]
            \centering
            \includegraphics{image.png}
            \caption{some caption}
            \label{fig:thing}
            \end{figure}
        
        or this html:
        
        .. code:: html
        
            <p>Look at <a href="#fig:thing">Figure 1</a>.</p>
        
            <div class="figure" id="fig:thing">
            <img src="image.png" alt="some caption" />
            <p class="caption">Figure 1: some caption</p>
            </div>
        
        For example input see the `spec <spec.md>`__ and for the output see
        `markdown <tests/spec.markdown>`__, `html <tests/spec.html>`__,
        `html5 <tests/spec.html5>`__ or `latex <tests/spec.latex>`__.
        
        Usage:
        ~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pandoc spec.md --filter internal-references.py --to latex
        
        alternately you can install it and use the command line link:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python setup.py install
            pandoc spec.md --filter internal-references --to latex
        
        Requires `pandocfilters <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandocfilters>`__
        and `pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`__.
        
        How it works:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In order to manage references we need to maintain some internal state
        that tracks the objects that can be referenced in the document. This is
        implemented with the ``ReferenceManager``.
        
        ``pandocfilters`` contains a function ``toJSONFilter`` that passes a
        given function over the entire document syntax tree and interfaces with
        pandoc via stdin/stdout.
        
        However, we need to walk the document tree twice, once to capture all of
        the objects (figures, sections, whatever) and again to change all of the
        internal links to the appropriate output. This requires a modified
        ``toJSONFilter`` that accepts a list of functions to pass the tree
        through sequentially.
        
        It is easy to determine the type of a reference object as we go along
        (whether figure, section or whatever) on the first pass and we can use
        this information to let us choose the right text for internal links on
        the second pass. This allows us to avoid being constrained to ids like
        '#fig:somefigure' to indicate a figure.
        
        TODO:
        ~~~~~
        
        -  [ ] allow switching off figure / section text replacement (perhaps
           using document metadata as the switch)
        
        -  [x] implement implicit internal reference link syntax for links to
           figures, i.e. ``[](#ref) == [#ref]``

        Very welcome. Make sure you add appropriate tests and use verbose commit
        messages and pull requests. Explain what you are trying to do in English
        so that I don't have to work it out through the code.
