django-autocomplete-light's purpose is to enable autocompletes quickly and
properly in a django project: it is the fruit of **years of R&D**. It was
designed for Django so that every part overridable or reusable independently.
It is stable, tested, documented and fully supported: it tries to be a good
neighbour in Django ecosystem.

**WARNING** you are currently on the v2 branch where new development happens.
            master (v1) is still supported for BC.

Features
--------

Features include:

- charfield, foreign key, many to many autocomplete widgets,
- generic foreign key, generic many to many autocomplete widgets,
- remote API backed-autocompletes,
- django template engine support for autocompletes, enabling you to include
  images etc ...
- 100% overridable HTML, CSS, Python and Javascript: there is no variable
  hidden far down in the scope anywhere.

- keyboard is supported with enter, tab and
  arrows by default.

Each feature has a live example and is fully documented. It is also designed
and documented so that you create your own awesome features too.

v2
--

`v2 branch <https://github.com/yourlabs/django-autocomplete-light/tree/v2>`_ is
under active development. You might want to use that instead, since it's much
easier to work with and supports python3.

In this case, please refer to the `v2 documentation
<http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/v2/>`_.

**To upgrade to v2**, please enjoy the `v1 to v2 upgrade instructions
<http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/v2/1to2.html>`_ (documented with love !).

- the Autocomplete class design hasn't changed at all.
- ``yourlabsWidget()`` doesn't parses ``data-*`` options the same,
- the django/form python code has been re-organised ie.
  ``get_widgets_dict()`` is gone and ``autocomplete_light.ModelForm``
  wraps around all features.
