Auto Ant
========

AutoAnt is a generic processing automation package. It's ideal for file processing, if you need
to process/syncronize/move files on several directories to different locations (local or remote)
and then renaming/moving/deleting or what ever you want. This is the answer.

It's extremely flexible and extensible, just describe your Sys Admin file/*something* processing nightmare
on a JSON file.
