[15 Jan 12:56] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +plarsen: So he's very busy between trying to wrap some things up at his old job, as well as take over the Fedora Project, trying to fix up his house to get ready to sell, find a new house, etc.
[15 Jan 12:56] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +plarsen: Not to mention he was out of town all weekend

[15 Jan 12:57] <jsmith!n=jsmith@72.21.36.138> +Naw, he'll be working out the Westford offices near Boston

[15 Jan 19:08] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +very pretty...
[15 Jan 19:08] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Yeah, actually I'll probably end up around Nashua, which is only about 35 min from the office
[15 Jan 19:08] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Lotsa white stuff I hear

[15 Jan 19:08] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I like winter.  Even snowy winter.
[15 Jan 19:08] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Summer, not so much.

[15 Jan 19:08] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Hey, it gets hot enough to swim there, that's good enough for me
[15 Jan 19:09] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> A friend gave me lots of information on the NH areas to look at
[15 Jan 19:09] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +just make sure your new house has an indoor pool ;)

[15 Jan 19:12] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I guess I need to do that.
[15 Jan 19:12] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +but i'll clean it out tomoorw and keep my eyes open

[15 Jan 19:13] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> It went GREAT.
[15 Jan 19:13] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> We should get together for a lunch

[15 Jan 19:16] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> heh
[15 Jan 19:16] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +stickster: they taking care of the move too?
[15 Jan 19:16] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: Yeah, the deal worked out pretty good.
[15 Jan 19:17] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I mean, they're not handing me big bags o' cash, but it will be enough that we can make things work fine
[15 Jan 19:17] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I'm a little bummed that I'm probably going to have to price my house to sell
[15 Jan 19:17] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> And I am REALLY upset at how much realtors end up costing when your house has gone up in value :-D
[15 Jan 19:17] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea, i think you're right on that one
[15 Jan 19:18] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +the rich get richer...
[15 Jan 19:18] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> They gave me 9 months to get there
[15 Jan 19:18] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +oh wow
[15 Jan 19:18] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I can remote until then
[15 Jan 19:18] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> But I feel like if I don't get to the office soon it will put me at a disadvantage
[15 Jan 19:18] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +maybe summer will see things turn around..
[15 Jan 19:18] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, can't wait that long I think.
[15 Jan 19:18] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +Ic
[15 Jan 19:19] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +you're going to be a good czar :)
[15 Jan 19:19] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> They're being really superflexible, I think that I'm the one who is making it into a "must-do-now" thing
[15 Jan 19:19] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> hang on, brb
[15 Jan 19:19] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +10-4, i dont blame you for getting on with it
[15 Jan 19:22] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Just putting something on the tube for the kids until bedtime
[15 Jan 19:23] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so is the rest of the fam as excited as you?
[15 Jan 19:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: I think so
[15 Jan 19:23] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> At first we thought we'd be going to Raleigh, but it became really clear that the best way to do this job was in Westford
[15 Jan 19:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> A lot of it involves communication with the Engineering folks up there, lots of RHEL managers
[15 Jan 19:24] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +so MA is where all the real work gets done?
[15 Jan 19:24] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> So doing that f2f is probably a lot better... plus there's a big Fedora staff there, lots of the folks I know... Jesse Keating, Jeremy Katz, Tom Callaway, Luke Macken, etc.
[15 Jan 19:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: Yeah, at least the coding work
[15 Jan 19:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> There are a few engineers in Raleigh, but about 95% of those guys are in MA.
[15 Jan 19:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Bill Nottingham, for example, is in NC.
[15 Jan 19:25] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> So I start orientation on the 4th, but I'm staying a whole week to make meetings with Legal, Marketing/BrandComm, GLS, etc.
[15 Jan 19:26] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +im guessing you're planning on leaving the fam here for a bit?
[15 Jan 19:27] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: Well, just for when I do my orientation
[15 Jan 19:27] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> And I might have to do a trip to BOS for maybe a week too
[15 Jan 19:27] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> But really, no
[15 Jan 19:27] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +well give a shout if you need anything
[15 Jan 19:27] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Since I can remote for <= 9months, we can all move together
[15 Jan 19:28] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Originally I was thinking we needed to sell and buy at the same time, which would have been... well, hard.
[15 Jan 19:28] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ahh i got the impression that you wanted to be there 4 weeks a month
[15 Jan 19:28] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +starting in feb
[15 Jan 19:28] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, I do want to be there ASAP, but not without them :-)
[15 Jan 19:28] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:)
[15 Jan 19:28] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I'm increasingly thinking (thanks to wiser friends) that we should rent for a few months up in NH and then buy a place
[15 Jan 19:28] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Probably easier even if it means moving twice
[15 Jan 19:29] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I think i'd agree too
[15 Jan 19:29] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I can't believe I'm going to work in the same company as Alan (#*%&ing Cox!
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:D
[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Oh yeah, and Dave Jones... Greg DeKoenigsberg...
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +you da man

[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I just hang around with people who are da man
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +HAH
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +*whatever*
[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> But I can be a good figurehead apparently
[15 Jan 19:30] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Lots of hot air and not much substance, y'know
[15 Jan 19:30] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +indeed i do
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> FUDCon was awesome
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> We should definitely get you involved so you could meet some of the hackers
[15 Jan 19:31] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +everything go fine with the airport shuffle and jsmith?
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Just fine
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> His plane was delayed until almost 1am, but it was no big deal
[15 Jan 19:31] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Easy drive
[15 Jan 19:31] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +wow, I thought the whole city of Richmond closed at 9
[15 Jan 19:32] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, this was picking him up at RDU
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +yea, I'd like to swing FUDCon sometimes
[15 Jan 19:32] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I dropped him off at RIC on Sunday night, no problem there either
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +I was hoping to get a RH certification one of these years..
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ahh
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +well good
[15 Jan 19:32] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd: So you do Linux development stuff at work, right?
[15 Jan 19:32] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +VERY little
[15 Jan 19:32] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Hm
[15 Jan 19:33] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, there will be another FUDCon style hackfest and Fedora sessions at the Red Hat Summit in Boston in June
[15 Jan 19:33] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +that sounds like it could be a very good time
[15 Jan 19:33] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> You should try and make that GETA training. It's actually a pretty cheap treat
[15 Jan 19:33] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +ill mark it on the calendar :)
[15 Jan 19:34] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> ISTR it's like $995 for registration and entry to everything
[15 Jan 19:34] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +that is cheap
[15 Jan 19:34] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> So with travel, RIC -> BOS you should be able to bring it in for well under $2K
[15 Jan 19:34] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +most def
[15 Jan 19:34] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +our unit is (or at least has been) really good about training too
[15 Jan 19:35] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> You can see as much RHEL stuff as you want, meet the F Project guys at the hackfest, come out with us for the parties at night (to the extent you like that sort of thing)
[15 Jan 19:35] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +im sold.
[15 Jan 19:35] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Cool, I'm holding you to it :-)
[15 Jan 19:35] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> And maybe jsmith-away too if he can swing it
[15 Jan 19:36] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +sounds like community relations to me :)
[15 Jan 19:36] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Exactly
[15 Jan 19:36] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> jsmith-away is so excited -- I think he really had a great time there
[15 Jan 19:36] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> And I got him hooked up with Mike McGrath, our Infrastructure community honcho
[15 Jan 19:36] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> They may be working up some Asterisk stuff for us, and hopefully a couple other cool projects
[15 Jan 19:37] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +an open souce company using an open source pbx?
[15 Jan 19:37] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +:p
[15 Jan 19:37] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Well, at least for Fedora, I mean
[15 Jan 19:37] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I told him he needs to work that other angle too ;-)
[15 Jan 19:37] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +i think its a great idea
[15 Jan 19:37] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> All right, I'm gonna run to another desktop to do some work, but feel free to shout at me if you need something
[15 Jan 19:37] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +sure, you too
[15 Jan 19:38] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +and like i said, let us know if you need anything
[15 Jan 19:38] <quigleymd!n=quigley@c-24-30-241-47.hsd1.va.comcast.net> +as we're local :)
[15 Jan 19:39] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> I will, you guys are the greatest
[15 Jan 19:39] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> quigleymd:  Do you want some lamps by any chance?
[15 Jan 19:39] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> In perfectly good shape, just we don't want them anymore (and anything we don't want and have to move, we just have to find a place for later)
[15 Jan 19:40] * stickster runs afk for a bit for kids' story time and bedtime
[15 Jan 20:38] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> jsmith-away: Help!
[15 Jan 20:39] <stickster!n=paul@fedora/stickster> Who ate with us on Friday night?  You, me, Clint, Toshio, Michael DeHaan, Chris Negus, and... ?
