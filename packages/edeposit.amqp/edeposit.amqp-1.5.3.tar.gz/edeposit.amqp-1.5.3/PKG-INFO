            - Added tracebacks to the headers, if the exception is thrown.
            - ``RABBITMQ_ALEPH_DAEMON_QUEUE`` renamed to ``RABBITMQ_ALEPH_INPUT_QUEUE``
            - ``RABBITMQ_ALEPH_PLONE_QUEUE`` renamed to ``RABBITMQ_ALEPH_OUTPUT_QUEUE``
            - ``RABBITMQ_ALEPH_DAEMON_KEY`` renamed to ``RABBITMQ_ALEPH_INPUT_KEY``.

            - Images in documentation were downloaded to _static.
            - Changed internal way of handling AMQP communication. This shouldn't change user API.
            - Documentation updated to reflect changes in internal API. Added UML diagrams.
        
        1.2.0 - 1.2.2
        -------------

            - edeposit.amqp.serializers API changed, so this module needed to be adjusted.
