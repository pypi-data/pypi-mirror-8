Hjson, the Human JSON. A data format that caters to humans and helps reduce the errors they make.

It supports `#`, `//` and `/**/` style comments as well as avoiding trailing/missing comma and other mistakes. For details and syntax see http://laktak.github.io/hjson.

hjson-py should work on Python 2.5+ and Python 3.3+ (forked from from simplejson)
