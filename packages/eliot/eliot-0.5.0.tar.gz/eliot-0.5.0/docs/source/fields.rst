Message Fields in Depth
=======================

Built-in Fields
---------------

The following fields are reserved by Eliot's built-in message structure and should not be added to messages you create:

The following fields are present in all messages.
Each message is uniquely identified by the combined values in these fields.

* ``task_uuid``: The task (top-level action) this message is part of.
* ``task_level``: The specific action this message is part of within the task's tree of actions.
  For example, ``"/3/2"`` indicates the message is part of the 2nd child action of the 3rd child action of the root action (i.e. the task.).
  ``"/"`` indicates the root action (i.e. the task).
* ``action_counter``: The index of the message within the current action.

In addition, the following field will also be present:

* ``timestamp``: Number of seconds since Unix epoch as a ``float`` (the output of ``time.time()``).
  Since system time may move backwards and resolution may not be high enough this cannot be relied on for message ordering.

Assuming you are using ``MessageType`` and ``ActionType`` every logged message will have either ``message_type`` or ``action_type`` fields depending whether they originated as a standalone message or as the start or end of an action.
Present in regular messages:

* ``message_type``: The type of the message, e.g. ``"yourapp:yoursubsystem:yourmessage"``.

Present in action messages:

* ``action_type``: The type of the action, e.g. ``"yourapp:yoursubsystem:youraction"``.
* ``action_status``: One of ``"started"``, ``"succeeded"`` or ``"failed"``.

The following fields can be added to your messages, but should preserve the same meaning:

* ``exception``: The fully qualified Python name (i.e. import path) of an exception type, e.g. ``"yourpackage.yourmodule.YourException"``.
* ``reason``: A prose string explaining why something happened. Avoid usage if possible, better to use structured data.
* ``traceback``: A string with a traceback.
* ``system``: A string, a subsystem in your application, e.g. ``"yourapp:yoursubsystem"``.


User-Created Fields
-------------------

It is recommended, but not necessary (and perhaps impossible across organizations) that fields with the same name have the same semantic content.
