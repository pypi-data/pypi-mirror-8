As the name implies, this package provides utilities related to the detection
of peaks for 1D data, such as estimating the baseline, finding the indexes of
the peaks in the data and performing Gaussian fitting or centroid computation
to further increase the resolution of the peak detection.

The documentation is available at http://pythonhosted.org/PeakUtils .
