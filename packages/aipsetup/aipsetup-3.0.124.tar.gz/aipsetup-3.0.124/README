Hi All

I'm AGUtilities, and I'm mainteining my own GNU/Linux distribution,
it's called Atlas WayRound GNU/Linux (Atlas Linux for short). While
i've moved to my target, I realized that there is no packaging system,
suitable by my requests. So I decided to write My own. So here it
is. I called it `aipsetup'

~~~

What does it do?

For My own, I needed software to easily build pack install and
uninstall different software packages on system. So, basic properties
of this tools are follow:

1. easy extraction source tarball
2. flexible building system
3. easy and fast pack
4. installing packages
5. uninstalling packages
6. checking installed package integrity
etc

~~~

Installation.

Download lattest aipsetup package from
http://wayround.org/mirrors/AtlasLinux/aipsetup/ , extract it
somewhere, and do:

make install

It will be installed in /usr/lib/aipsetup directory, and executable
file, will be placed to /usr/bin.

Installation is now complite :-)

~~~

Usage.

~~~~~~~~
One command program build
~~~~~~~~

if your' aipsetup has propriaste template installed, then You can
build many apps by one single command:

aipsetup bd wine wine-1.1.31.tar.gz

 where:
  aipsetup           - command
  bd       	     - aipsetup command
  wine     	     - template aipsetup must use to build package
  wine-1.1.31.tar.gz - sources ( can be multiple filenames or wildcard)

aipsetup, internaly, does all staff, including extraction, building
and packaging.

on the end, You'll have pack directory with new, ready to install
package, or if any errors will happen, log of all operation

~~~~~~~~
File extraction
~~~~~~~~

aipsetup ex filename

will extract fiven file to current dir

~~~~~~~~
Compilling building script 
~~~~~~~~

aipsetup sc wine

Will create build script for building package.

This command assumed to be deploid right in the first source dir ofthe
package. 

~~~~~~~~
Building packare
~~~~~~~~

execute script created by aipsetup with bash and it will build
package, logging all process to package's 'var' dir.

~~~~~~~~
Creating installation package
~~~~~~~~

Go to new package dir and command

aipsetup pk

and it will create package in ../pack directory

~~~~~~~~
Installing and uninstallin package
~~~~~~~~

package can be installed or uninstalled

aipsetup in 'package filename or wildcard'
aipsetup in wine-*.tar.bz2

aipsetup rm 'package filename or wildcard'
aipsetup rm 'wine-*'

~~~~~~~~
List installed packages
~~~~~~~~

aipsetup ls 'wine-*'


~~~~~~~~~~~

aipsetup have also some nice tools for serchid dependenties and things
like thet. See aipsetup --help

~~

Finally I have updated this README. 

be Happy
