 --> wiki style flavor without the bad wiki aftertaste <--


Abstract::
----------

 wicked is a framework addition to Archetypes to allow developers to add
 wiki-ish behavior to AT content objects via a schema field.


Premise::
---------

 Wiki does two things really well: convenient document creation,
 immediate interlinking of documents.  To leverage these features,
 wiki's have a nasty tendency to aggregate random other features.

 wicked will attempt to reduce 'wiki' to a feature of content rather
 by stripping away everything except for providing a framework for
 creating, tracking, and managing wiki links within a CMF site.
 wicked will yield all other feature unto the CMS


Goals::
-------

 - Easy link based creation of content

 - Easy intuitive linking of content by explicit wiki links

 - Reference system for relating interlinked content
