DuctApe is a python library with a series of command-line programs that will help bioinformaticians to analyze genomes AND phenomic experiments. The final purpose of the program is to combine the genomic informations (encoded as KEGG pathways) with the results of phenomic experiments (for now the Phenotype microarrays are supported) and highlight the genes that may be responsible for phenotypic variations. Several scientific python libraries are used to perform this tasks: all the data is stored in a portable database file to allow an easy exchange of results. The most complex computing tasks are speeded up by parallelization. There are three distinct programs with an expressive syntax to ensure flexibility in the analysis, while keeping it simple.
