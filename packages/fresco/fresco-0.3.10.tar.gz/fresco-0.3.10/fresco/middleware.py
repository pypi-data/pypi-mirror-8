class XForwarded(object):
    """\
    Modify the WSGI environment so that the X_FORWARDED_* headers are observed
    and generated URIs are correct in a proxied environment.

    Use this whenever the WSGI application server is sitting behind
    Apache or another proxy server.

    It is easy for clients to spoof the X-Forwarded-For header. You can largely
    protect against this by listing all trusted proxy server addresses in
    ``trusted``. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For for more
    details.

    HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR is substituted for REMOTE_ADDR and
    HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST for SERVER_NAME. If HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SSL is set, then
    the wsgi.url_scheme is modified to ``https`` and ``HTTPS`` is set to
    ``on``.

    Example::

        >>> from fresco import FrescoApp, context, GET, Response
        >>> from flea import TestAgent
        >>> app = FrescoApp()
        >>> @app.route('/', GET)
        ... def view():
        ...     return Response(["URL is ", context.request.url,
        ...                      "; REMOTE_ADDR is ",
        ...                      context.request.remote_addr])
        ...
        >>> r = TestAgent(XForwarded(app))
        >>> response = r.get('/',
        ...     SERVER_NAME='wsgiserver-name',
        ...     SERVER_PORT='8080',
