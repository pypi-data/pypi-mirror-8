        Overview
        ========
        
        PloneGlossary is a Plone content type that allows you to manage your
        own glossaries, propose definitions and search in one or more
        glossaries. Any word defined is instantly highlighted in the content
        of your site.
        
        After adding a glossary, you can add your definitions to
        it. Definitions are a simple content type. Enter the word you want to
        define as the title, and the definition of the word in the text
        body. You can also specify variants of the word. For example if you
        define the word yoghurt, you may also want to allow the variants
        yogurt or yoghourt to be valid. Definitions will be highlighted (like
        an acronym) when they appear elsewhere in your site. (Also see the
        ploneglossary configlet.)
        
        Once you have a large number of definitions in your glossary, you can
        browse the glossary by the means of an alphabetic index, or perform a
        search in the glossary. Each glossary has an integrated search engine,
        which is simply a ZCatalog.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Plone 3.x or 4.x
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        Installing the latest release
        -----------------------------
        
        Of course use zc.buildout. Just add this line to your buildout.cfg::
        
          [instance]
          recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
          ...
          eggs =
              ...
              Products.PloneGlossary
        
        
        Installing a clone from github
        ------------------------------
        
        We assume that your instance has been built with the `plone3_buildout`
        template for the paste script (otherwise you should change
        instructions accordingly)::
        
          $ cd $BUILDOUT_HOME/src
          $ git clone git@github.com:collective/Products.PloneGlossary.git
          $ cd Products.PloneGlossary
          $ python setup.py develop
        
        Then edit your `buildout.cfg`::
        
          [buildout]
          ...
          develop =
              ...
              src/Products.PloneGlossary
        
        And change the `[instance]` section as described in `Installing the
        latest release`_ above.
        
        
        Plone Unicode issue
        ===================
        
        If you use an old version of Plone (< 3.2), you'll encounter `this issue
        <http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7522>`_: using non ASCII characters in
        your glossary requires to change the default encoding of your Zope.
        
        To do this, add a `sitecustomize.py` file to your $SOFTWARE_HOME with
        these two lines::
        
          import sys
          sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')
        
        Then replace "utf-8" above with the value of the "default_charset" property
        in your "portal_properties/site_properties".
        
        
        Upgrades
        ========
        
        Visit in ZMI the `portal_setup` object of your site, click `Upgrades`
        and select `Products.PloneGlossary:default`.
        
        If you're upgrading from PloneGlossary 1.2 or older you may force
        upgrades using "Show old upgrades".
        
        Configuring
        ===========
        
        Add a glossary portlet
        ----------------------
        
        Use the portlets manager to display a portlet of all definitions found
        in the displayed content.
        
        zope.conf tweaks (optional)
        ---------------------------
        
        PloneGlossary assumes that your site charset is UTF-8.
        
        PloneGlossary views have a batch size of 30 terms. You might prefer
        another size.
        
        If you need another batch size, you might append this to your `zope.conf`::
        
          <product-config ploneglossary>
            batch-size 40 # Or any positive integer you might prefer.
          </product-config>
        
        
        The Glossary configlet
        ----------------------
        
        Highlight content: if this option is chosen, all defined words
        are highlighted in the chosen content types (see further).
        
        Description length : Choose the maximum length of the given definition
        in the highlights.
        
        Description ellipsis: Choose an ellipsis. It is used in the highlight
        when the defined term exceeds the description length.
        
        Not highlighted tags: Define the html tags in which definitions should
        not be highlighted. Default: h1, a, input, textarea
        
        Allowed portal types: Select the portal types for which defined words
        are highlighted.
        
        Use glossaries globally for all content?: When checked, all glossaries
        will be used to highlight terms globally for all of the site's
        content. By unchecking this option, only the first glossary found
        while traversing upwards from the content is used.
        
        General glossaries: Select glossaries used to check related terms of
        content.
        
        Additional tools
        ----------------
        
        A tool is installed by the installer. It provides a few configuration
        options (managed in the configlet) so that you can customize and
        manage your glossaries.
        
        Switch highlighting on or off per object
        ----------------------------------------
        
        Since version 1.5.0 there is support for switching the highlighting on
        of off per object.  The default behaviour is still that the tool
        simply checks if the current object is in the allowed portal types
        that are set in the configuration.  Version 1.5.0 introduces an
        interface ``IOptionalHighLight``.  The tool tries to adapt the current
        object to that interface.  If this succeeds, the decision to highlight
        terms is given to the ``do_highlight`` method of the found adapter.
        The canonical implementation is in an optional package
        `zest.ploneglossaryhighlight`_; when installed this gives an extra
        field in the settings tab of content items where you can switch
        highlighting on or off.  See that package for more info.

        Change log
        ==========
        
        1.7.1 (2014-11-07)
        ==================
        
        - Add ``Products.PloneTestCase`` to the ``test`` extra requirements.
          [maurits]
        
        - Add an option in the Glossary control panel to highlight only the first word
          found on a page. This is useful in for example scientific documents where the
          same terms are used a lot, which can cause excessive highlighting. Disabled
          by default to keep default behaviour (highlight all terms found).
          [fredvd]
        
        
        1.7 (2014-01-10)
        ================
        
        - If terms are not highlighted in the content area of a portal_type,
          do not show the definitions in a portlet either.
          [maurits]
        
        - Use the SearchableText indexer to see which text to highlight.  Fall
          back to SearchableText.  This supports dexterity, if an indexer is
          defined explicitly for a content type (like is done in
          ``plone.app.contenttypes``) or dynamically with a behavior
          (``collective.dexteritytextindexer``).  Note that it is better to
          not activate glossary highlighting for files, because then every
          time you view a file, the indexer will likely call an external
          program to convert the file to plain text.
          [maurits]
        
        - Do not require a ``ploneglossary.txt`` in our ``ploneglossarytool``
          import step for importing settings.  The ``glossary.xml`` file
          already functions as a flag file.  The text file is only needed as
          flag file for our ``ploneglossary-reg`` import step.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/ploneglossary/issues/8
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.6 (2013-08-26)
        ================
        
        - Change the condition for ``ploneglossary.css`` so it does not give
          an error when accessing the Dexterity control panel, which does not
          allow access to ``meta_type``.  Note that if you have customized
          PloneGlossary and kept the same meta_type but have given it a
          different portal_type, you will need to change the condition
          accordingly.  Includes upgrade step.
          Fixes https://github.com/collective/Products.PloneGlossary/issues/3
          [maurits
        
        - Removed use of linkOpaque.gif. It failed in Plone 4.3 and was not
          actually needed.
          Fixes https://github.com/collective/Products.PloneGlossary/issues/1
          [maurits]
        
        - Removed relatedItems slot for Plone 4.3 compatibility
          [tom_gross]
        
        
        1.5.3-FHNW1 (2012-11-22)
        ========================
        
        - Removed support for other encodings as UTF-8 and simplified code.
          Encodings other than UTF-8 are currently not supported by Plone
          [tom_gross]
        
        
        1.5.3 (2012-10-14)
        ==================
        
        * Add Plone 4.3 compatibility by avoiding hard dependency on zope.app
          packages.
          [maurits]
        
        * Moved to https://github.com/collective/Products.PloneGlossary
          [maurits]
        
        * do catalog dispatching right
          [tom_gross]
        
        * added uninstall profile
          [micecchi]
        
        
        1.5.2.3 (2012-04-03)
        ====================
        
        * removed pointless blather logging messages
          [ajung]

          [ajung]
        
        
        1.5.2 (2012-01-22)
        ==================
        
        * ensure that terms are sorted in descending term length in order to match
          terms with the same prefix properly (longest matches first) 
          [ajung]
        
        
        1.5.1 (2011-12-08)
        ==================
        
        * italian translation added
          [giacomos]
        
        
        1.5.0 (2011-11-24)
        ==================
        
        * Added support for switching highlighting on or off per object.  You
          need to write an adapter if you want to use this.  See for example
          https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.ploneglossaryhighlight
          [maurits]
        
        * PeP8, Pyflakes and i18n cleanup.

          [glenfant]
        
        * Call portal_catalog.n_indexObject instead of BaseObject.n_indexObject. Latter
          one causes collective.indexing crash due to recursion error.

        ======================
        
        * Upgrades moved to the GenericSetup way, and removed (useless)
          "Migration" tab.
          [glenfant]
        
        * i18n of schemas using message factory.
          [glenfant]
        
        * Fixed test fixtures and associated GS profile.

          content"

          [naro]
        
        * use the standard PropertyManager API to handle properties on the tool
          [wichert]

          [wichert]

        * Changed portlet into Plone 3 style
          [glenfant]
        
        * Fixed unit tests (new worflow doesn't allow anon to grab into
          glossary)
          [glenfant]
        
        * Adding a /browser for new style views
          [glenfant]
        
        * Fix bug causing html entities in definition title/description to
          appear as entity code instead of char ( ie. &amp; instead of & )
        
        * Install: check for scripts/CSS before registering them
        
        * Added support for Generic setup for the main tool

        * Added test environment

        * Added czech translation (Lukas Zdych)
        
        * Added a patch for ZCTextIndex _apply_index method: search terms with
          synonymous found in global glossaries are replaced by an equivalent
          "OR". By default this is done only for 'SearchableText' . This patch
          is disabled by default (see config.py). [bmathieu]
        
        * Fill portlet by template construct instead of javascript [bmathieu]
        
        * Dropped plone 2.0 compatibility: use css and javascript
          registries. Portlet structure complies with plone 2.1/2.5 standard
          structures.  Improved: highlight definitions whether portlet is
          displayed or not. [bmathieu]

        * Added polish translation thanks to Piotr Furman
        
        * Fixed a problem in htm2text. Carriage returns were not interpreted
          as white space. This resulted in combined words to be merged.  For
          example: "<div>plone\r\nglossary</div>" -> "ploneglossary" instead
          of "plone glossary".

        * Use the same normalizer of lexicon to parse SearchableText
        
        * Add method rebuildCatalog on PloneGlossary to rebuild all glossary
          catalog
        
        * Update javascript highlighting words to work on Firefox and IE
        
        * Fixed access problem to glossary's catalogs for anonymous users -
          [zegor]
        
        * Use AddPortalContent permission to add Glossary and definitions
