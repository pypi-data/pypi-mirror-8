PloneGlossary is a Plone content type that allows you to manage your
own glossaries, propose definitions and search in one or more
glossaries. Any word defined is instantly highlighted in the content
of your site.

After adding a glossary, you can add your definitions to
it. Definitions are a simple content type. Enter the word you want to
define as the title, and the definition of the word in the text
body. You can also specify variants of the word. For example if you
define the word yoghurt, you may also want to allow the variants
yogurt or yoghourt to be valid. Definitions will be highlighted (like
an acronym) when they appear elsewhere in your site. (Also see the
ploneglossary configlet.)

Once you have a large number of definitions in your glossary, you can
browse the glossary by the means of an alphabetic index, or perform a
search in the glossary. Each glossary has an integrated search engine,
which is simply a ZCatalog.
