* Cleanup code (we don't need to keep backward compat) to use Zope
  2.10/Plone 3.0.

* i18n cleanup and sync (mail to translators, see README.txt)

* Have the definitions "wicked aware" is essential in a glossary, but
  Wiki support seems buggy since it doesn't work in ATCT anymore
  today.

* Remove the /content/schemata.py dispatch its code in content types
  modules and utils.py.
