1.7.1 (2014-11-07)
==================

- Add ``Products.PloneTestCase`` to the ``test`` extra requirements.
  [maurits]

- Add an option in the Glossary control panel to highlight only the first word
  found on a page. This is useful in for example scientific documents where the
  same terms are used a lot, which can cause excessive highlighting. Disabled
  by default to keep default behaviour (highlight all terms found).
  [fredvd]


1.7 (2014-01-10)
================

- If terms are not highlighted in the content area of a portal_type,
  do not show the definitions in a portlet either.
  [maurits]

- Use the SearchableText indexer to see which text to highlight.  Fall
  back to SearchableText.  This supports dexterity, if an indexer is
  defined explicitly for a content type (like is done in
  ``plone.app.contenttypes``) or dynamically with a behavior
  (``collective.dexteritytextindexer``).  Note that it is better to
  not activate glossary highlighting for files, because then every
  time you view a file, the indexer will likely call an external
  program to convert the file to plain text.
  [maurits]

- Do not require a ``ploneglossary.txt`` in our ``ploneglossarytool``
  import step for importing settings.  The ``glossary.xml`` file
  already functions as a flag file.  The text file is only needed as
  flag file for our ``ploneglossary-reg`` import step.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/ploneglossary/issues/8
  [maurits]


1.6 (2013-08-26)
================

- Change the condition for ``ploneglossary.css`` so it does not give
  an error when accessing the Dexterity control panel, which does not
  allow access to ``meta_type``.  Note that if you have customized
  PloneGlossary and kept the same meta_type but have given it a
  different portal_type, you will need to change the condition
  accordingly.  Includes upgrade step.
  Fixes https://github.com/collective/Products.PloneGlossary/issues/3
  [maurits

- Removed use of linkOpaque.gif. It failed in Plone 4.3 and was not
  actually needed.
  Fixes https://github.com/collective/Products.PloneGlossary/issues/1
  [maurits]

- Removed relatedItems slot for Plone 4.3 compatibility
  [tom_gross]
