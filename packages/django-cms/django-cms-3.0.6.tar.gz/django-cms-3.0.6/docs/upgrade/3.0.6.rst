*******************
What's new in 3.0.6
*******************

Experimental Django 1.7 support
===============================

Since 3.0.6 django CMS has experimental Django 1.7 support.

.. warning:: **Migration changes**

    As support is marked as experimental, Django migrations **may** change
    at least until Django 1.7.1 release.

Currently Django 1.7 migrations are shipped in non-default ``migrations_django``
package to allow better backward compatibility; in future releases the Django
migrations will be moved to standard ``migrations`` package with the South
ones in ``south_migrations``.
At this stage you are required to add::

    MIGRATION_MODULES = {
        'cms': 'cms.migrations_django',
        'menus': 'menus.migrations_django',
    }

.. warning:: **MySQL support**

    As of now MySQL is not *officially* supported on Django 1.7: it's known
    to work, but still some corner cases in tests have to be addressed.


.. warning:: **Applications migrations**

    By Django 1.7 migrations design **every** application that defines
    a django CMS plugin or a model that uses a PlaceholderField or depends
    in any way on django CMS models **must** define Django 1.7 migrations.

Extended Custom User Support
============================

If you are using custom user models and use ``CMS_PERMISSIONS = True`` then be sure
to check that PageUserAdmin and PageUserGroup is still in working order.

The PageUserAdmin class now extends dynamically from the admin class that handles the user
model. This allows that we use the same search_fields and filters in PageUserAdmin as in
the custom user model admin.
