        Features
        --------
        
        -  The server indexes UTXOs by address, in a Patricia tree structure
           described by Alan Reiner (see the 'ultimate blockchain compression'
           thread in the Bitcointalk forum)
        
        -  The server requires reddcoind, leveldb and plyvel
        
        -  The server code is open source. Anyone can run a server, removing
           single points of failure concerns.
        
        -  The server knows which set of Reddcoin addresses belong to the same
           wallet, which might raise concerns about anonymity. However, it
           should be possible to write clients capable of using several servers.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        1. To install and run a server, see INSTALL. For greater detail on the
           installation process, see HOWTO.md.
        
        2. To start and stop the server, use the 'electrum-server' script
