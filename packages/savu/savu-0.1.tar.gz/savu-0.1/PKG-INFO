Description: Savu
        ----
        
        Savu pythons are known for their small size, good temperament, easy feeding habits and tolerance for a wide range of temperatures.[1]
        The Savu Tomography reconstruction pipeline project aims to mimic these behaviours being a small package, which is easy to use and reliable, chomps its way through vast amounts of data, and finally is portable to a wide range of systems.
