Changelog
---------

0.3 (2014-10-22):
   This release adds new features and fixes bugs. The main change is
   that it is now possible to leave out the `ui` key from the zapp
   configuration. Before that would signal that the default web
   interface should be generated by `zpm deploy`, it now means no web
   interface. To get the default interface, specify `--with-ui` when
   running `zpm new`.

   Issues closed since 0.2.1:

   * `#109`_: Add web frontend as an option of `zpm new`, don't
     generate it on `zpm bundle`.

   * `#131`_: `zpm deploy -l debug` should include request/response
     data.

   * `#157`_: Ubuntu package: install requires `python-swiftclient`.

   * `#158`_: Ubuntu package: update changelog for version 0.2.

   * `#167`_: `index.html` template rendering was broken.

   * `#173`_: Deduce auth version from environment variables.

   * `#177`_: Allow user to force deployment to a non-empty container
     with `zpm deploy`.

   * `#180`_: Add X-Nexe-Cdr-Line parsing and display.

   * `#183`_: Add `zpm auth` command for getting storage url and auth
     token.

0.2.1 (2014-07-20):
   This release fixes some minor packaging and distribution issues, as well
   as some of the behavior of the `deploy` command:

   * `python-swiftclient` is now an explicit dependency
   * `setup.py` uses `setuptools` instead of `distutils`
   * `deploy`: show full URL to the deployed index.html
   * `deploy`: set correct content type for zapp files
   * `deploy`: better management of containers (automatically create containers
     if not existing, don't allow deployment to a non-empty container)


0.2 (2014-06-30):
   This release drops support for Python 3.2 due to the lack of
   ``u"..."`` literals in that version. Other issues fixed:

   * `#20`_: Set up Debian packaging for zpm.

   * `#31`_: Use ``python-swiftclient`` instead of ``requests`` for
     interacting with Swift.

   * `#37`_: Added a ``zpm execute`` command.

   * `#119`_: ``zpm bundle`` did not raise errors when files in the
     bundling list don't exist.

   * `#122`_: Some ``zpm deploy`` references were not rendering
     correctly in the documentation.

   * `#132`_: Only process UI files ending in ``.tmpl`` as Jinja2
     templates.

0.1 (2014-05-21):
   First release.
