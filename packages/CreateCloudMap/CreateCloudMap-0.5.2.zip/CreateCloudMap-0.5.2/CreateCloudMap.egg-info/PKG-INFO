Description: CreateCloudMap
        ==============
        
        Python script to create a cloud map for xplanet using satellite images from the 
        `Dundee Satellite Receiving Station, Dundee University, UK <http://www.sat.dundee.ac.uk/>`_.
        This script can also be installed by pip from `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CreateCloudMap>`_.
        
        `xplanet <http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/>`_ can use a cloud map to make the earth look more pretty. 
        
        
        There is a free service which create one such cloud map per day. Due to a temporary unavailability 
        of that service this script `create_map` was developed to automatically download the necessary geostationary images 
        from the `Dundee Satellite Receiving Station, Dundee University, UK <http://www.sat.dundee.ac.uk/>`_. 
        To use this service you need an account there (which is free). Also a new cloud map can be created every three hours.
        
        Set your login information in the configuration file (default name for UNIX-like systems: ``$HOME/.CreateCloudMap/CreateCloudMap.ini``, for Windows: ``%HOME%\.CreateCloudMap\CreateCloudMap.ini``)::
        
          [Download]
          username = user
          password = secret
          tempdir = images
           # Use one of the followingj for resolution: medium, high
          resolution = medium
          purge = false
          
          [xplanet]
          destinationdir = xplanet/images
          destinationfile = clouds_2048.jpg
          width = 2048
          height = 1024
          
        If the configuration file already exists, a new version is copied to ``CreateCloudMap.ini.new`` to not overwrite the login data. 
        The old config file should work after an update, because default values are used for 
        newly introduced options.
        
        ``tempdir`` specifies the directory where the downloaded images (and if enabled by the command line 
        switch ``--debug`` or ``-d``) intermediate debug images are stored. For debug outputs to work, you need
        to (manually) install matplotlib and Basemap. ``destinationdir`` specifies the directory where 
        the output ``destinationfile`` is saved.
        
        ``resolution`` can be set to ``medium`` or ``high`` to determine the resolution
        of the downloaded satellite images (``low`` does not work at the moment.)
        
        If ``purge`` is set to true old satellite images will be deleted which are not 
        used to draw the current cloud map.
        
        ``width`` and ``height`` set the dimensions of the cloud map in ``destinationfile``.
        
        To see all command line options of the script use ``--help``::
        
        	$ create_map --help
        	usage: create_map [-h] [-d] [-c FILE] [-f]
        
        	optional arguments:
        	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        	  -d, --debug           store intermediate results
        	  -c FILE, --conf_file FILE
        	                        Specify config file
        	  -f, --force           Force to recreate cloud map
