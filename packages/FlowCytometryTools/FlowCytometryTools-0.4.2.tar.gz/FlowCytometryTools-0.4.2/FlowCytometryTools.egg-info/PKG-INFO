Description: FlowCytometryTools
        -------------------
        
        **Authors**: Jonathan Friedman and `Eugene Yurtsev <http://eyurtsev.mit.edu>`_
        
        FlowCytometryTools is a python package for visualization and analysis of high-throughput flow cytometry data.
        
        * **Intuitive**: provides a simple programmatic interface to work with flow cytometry data
        * **Flexible**: can analyze either individual samples or collections of many plates
        * **Scalable**: simplifies analysis of high-throughput data using the power of `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ 
        
        Who is this for?
        =====================
        
        FlowCytometryTools is for researchers who want to use the python programming language to analyze flow cytometry data.
        
        The package is specifically tailored for high-throughput analysis. It provides an interface that can directly work with collections of flow cytometry measurements (e.g., 96-well plates).
        
        Basic familiarity with the python programming languages is recommended.
        
        You can find a few example scripts that load and plot flow cytometry data in the `gallery <http://gorelab.bitbucket.org/flowcytometrytools/gallery.html>`_ page.
        
        If you like what you see, then proceed to the `installation <http://gorelab.bitbucket.org/flowcytometrytools/install.html>`_ page and then
        to the `tutorial <http://gorelab.bitbucket.org/flowcytometrytools/tutorial.html>`_.
        
        Features
        ===================
        
        - **Transformations**: hyperlog (hlog), truncated log (tlog), or anything you can dream of ;)
        - **Plotting**: 1D, 2D histograms for both single samples and collections (e.g., 96-well plates).
        - **Gating**: threshold, interval, quad, polygon gates
        - **Subsampling**: easy to subsample to examine only part of a measurement and randomize event order
        - **GUI**: simple graphical user interface to draw gates
        - **FCS Formats**: Supports FCS 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1

        Alternatives
        ===================
        
        FlowCytometryTools is not the only open source software for performing data analysis on flow cytometry data.
        
        So if you find that FlowCytometryTools does not suit your needs, take a look at the following software: 
        
        * `fcm <https://pythonhosted.org/fcm/basic.html>`_ : API for python
        * `Bioconductor <http://master.bioconductor.org/>`_ : API for the R programming language
        * `FlowPy <http://flowpy.wikidot.com/>`_ : GUI
        * `cyflogic <http://www.cyflogic.com/>`_ : GUI
        * `Flowing Software <http://www.flowingsoftware.com/>`_ : GUI
