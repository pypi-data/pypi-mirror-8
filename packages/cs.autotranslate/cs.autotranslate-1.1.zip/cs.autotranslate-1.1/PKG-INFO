Description: cs.autotranslate
        =================
        
        Do you go mad when creating images and files in Plone that
        you want to use through the different languages' sites?
        
        In previous versions of Plone did you create a 'neutral'
        folder and store there your images?
        
        Forget everything!!!
        
        Just create a folder, apply AutoTranslatable interface using
        Sub-Typer menu, and tadaaaaaa! All items created inside that
        folder will be translated automatically to all available
        languages.
        
        Only available for Archetypes based content.
