# Jasmine... For Python!

<a title="Build at Travis CI" href="https://travis-ci.org/pivotal/jasmine-py"><img src="https://api.travis-ci.org/pivotal/jasmine-py.png" /></a>

The [Jasmine](http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) Python package contains helper code for developing Jasmine projects for Python-based web projects (Django, Flask, etc.) or for JavaScript projects where Python is a welcome partner. It serves up a project's Jasmine suite in a browser so you can focus on your code instead of manually editing script tags in the Jasmine runner HTML file.

## Contents
This package contains:

* A small server that builds and executes a Jasmine suite for a project
* A command line script to run your tests (handy for continuous integration)

You can get all of this by: `pip install jasmine` or by adding `jasmine` to your `requirements.txt`.

## \__init__ A Project

To initialize a project for Jasmine:

	$ jasmine-install

This will create a spec directory and configuration yaml template for you.

#### Django Pipeline Support
If you want access to Django's asset pipeline, then you can create a Jasmine view within your app.  This feature currently under development, and is **not recommended** unless you absolutely need it.

* Add 'jasmine.django' to INSTALLED_APPS in your setting.py
* To display test results within your application, add a route to your urls.py: 

        url(r'^jasmine/', include('jasmine.django.urls', namespace='jasmine'))
* Test results are now visible at your.django.app/jasmine 
    * You may wish to protect this URL so it does not appear in the production deploy of your app

## Configuration

Customize `spec/javascripts/support/jasmine.yml` to enumerate the source files, stylesheets, and spec files you would like the Jasmine runner to include.
You may use dir glob strings.


## Usage

#### Standalone Server
Start the Jasmine server:

	$ jasmine

Point your browser to `localhost:8888`. The suite will run every time this page is re-loaded.

Start Jasmine on a different port:

	$ jasmine -p 1337

Point your browser to `localhost:1337`.

#### Continuous Integration

For Continuous Integration environments, add this task to the project build steps:

	$ jasmine-ci

The browser used by selenium can be changed by exporting `JASMINE_BROWSER` 

    $ export JASMINE_BROWSER=chrome
    $ jasmine-ci

or adding `--browser` to `jasmine-ci`

	$ jasmine-ci --browser firefox
