Motek Module
============

`Motek Medical`_ sells hardware/software packages which include treadmills with
force plate measurement capabilities and motion bases, motion capture systems,
visual displays, and other sensors for various measurements. Their software,
D-Flow_, manages the data streams from the various systems and is responsible
for displaying interactive visuals, sounds, and motions to the subject. The
:mod:`gaitanalysis.motek` module includes classes that eases processing the
data collected from typical D-Flow output files, but may have some limitations
with respect to the hardware because we only have one system available.

The Human Motion and Control Lab at Cleveland State University has such a
system. Our system includes:

- A ForceLink_ R-Mill_ which has dual 6 DoF force plates, independent belts for
  each foot, and lateral and pitch motion capabilities.
- A 10 Camera `Motion Analysis`_ motion capture system which includes the
  Cortex_ software and hardware for collecting analog and camera data
  simultaneously.
- Delsys_ wireless EMG + 3D Accelerometers.
- Motek Medical's D-Flow software and visual display system.

Cortex alone is capable of delivering data from the cameras, force plates, and
analog sensors (EMG/Accelerometer), but D-Flow is required to collect data from
digital sensors and the treadmill's motion (lateral, pitch, and belts). D-Flow
can output multiple types of files which contain the different data.

Our motion capture system's coordinate system is such that the X coordinate
points to the right, the Y coordinate points upwards, and the Z coordinate
follows from the right-hand-rule, i.e. points backwards with respect to a
person walking forward on the treadmill. The camera's coordinate system is
aligned to an origin point on treadmill's surface during camera calibration.

Mocap Module
============

D-Flow's mocap module has a file tab which allows you to export the time series
data collected from Cortex in two different file formats: `tab separated
values`_ (TSV) and the C3D format (see http://www.c3d.org). The TSV files are
approximately twice the size of the C3D files, don't maintain machine
precision, and do not allow for meta data storage. But for now, this software
only deals with the TSV file format.

.. _tab separated values: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values

The text file output from the mocap module in DFlow is a tab delimited file.
The first line is the header and contains a time stamp column, frame number
column, marker position columns, force plate force/moment columns, force plate
center of pressure columns, other analog columns, and potentially results from
the real time `Human Body Model`_ which is included with the D-Flow software.
These are detailed below. The numerical values of the measurements are provided
in decimal floating point notation with 6 decimals of precision, e.g.
``123456.123456`` [``%1.6f``].

.. _Human Body Model: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11517-013-1076-z

Data Column Descriptions
------------------------

Time Stamp
   The ``TimeStamp`` column records the D-Flow system time when it receives a
   "frame" from Cortex in seconds since D-Flow was started. This is
   approximately at 100 hz (Cortex's sample rate), but has slight variability
   per sample period, something like +/- 0.002 s or so. This column can be used
   to synchronize with other D-Flow output files which include a D-Flow time
   stamp, e.g. the output of the record module. The following figure shows the
   difference, ``.diff()``, of an example D-Flow time stamp, giving the
   variability in periods at each measurement instance.

   .. image:: d-flow-time-stamp-diff.png

Frame Number
   The ``FrameNumber`` column gives a positive integer to count the frame
   numbers delivered by Cortex. It seems as though none of the frames are
   ever dropped but this should be verified.
Marker Coordinates
   The columns that correspond to marker coordinates have one of three
   suffixes: ``.PosX``, ``.PosY``, ``.PosZ``. The prefix is the marker name
   which is set by providing a name to the marker in Cortex. There are specific
   names which are required for D-Flow's Human Body Model's computations. The
   marker coordinates are given in meters. See below for some additional
   virtual markers.
Force Plate Kinetics
   There are three forces and three moments recorded by each of the two force
   plates in Newtons and Newton-Meters, respectively. The prefix for these
   columns is either ``FP1`` or ``FP2`` and represents either force plate 1
   (left) or 2 (right). The suffixes are either ``.For[XYZ]``, ``.Mom[XYZ]``
   for the forces and moments, respectively. The force plate voltages are
   sampled at a much higher frequency than the cameras, but delivered at the
   Cortex camera sample rate, 100 Hz through the D-Flow mocap module. A
   force/moment calibration matrix stored in Cortex converts the voltages to
   forces and moments before sending it to D-Flow [#]_. Cortex also computes
   the center of pressure from the forces, moments, and force plate dimensions.
   These have the same prefixes for the plate number, have the suffix
   ``.Cop[XYZ]``, and are in meters.
Analog Channels
   Cortex can sample additional analog channels. These columns have headers
   which take this form ``Channel[1-99].Anlg`` and the names are fixed to
   correspond to the channels in the National Instruments DAQ box which samples
   the analog sensors. The first twelve of these are reserved for the force
   plate voltage measurements. These correspond to the voltages of the force
   sensors in the two force plates and are as follows (channels 1-12).

   2. F1Y2
   3. F1Y3

      |            |             |
      ----------------------------

   The remaining analog channels are connected to the 16 Delsys
   EMG/Accelerometers measurements. Each sensor has four signals: EMG, AccX,
   AccY, and AccZ. The are ordered in the remaining channels as:

   13. EMG1
   14. ACCX1
   15. ACCY1
   16. ACCZ1
   17. EMG2
   18. ACCX2
   19. ACCY2
   20. ACCZ2
   21. etc.

   **Note that all of the signals are in volts!**. You must scale them
   yourself.

   .. note::

      The EMG/Acceleromter channels are 96 milliseconds behind the force plate
      measurements, according to the DelSys manual [#]_. There may be other
      delays present too that may or may not be taken care of in Cortex or
      D-Flow. The lag of the EMG/Accelerometers is due to the wireless
      communication.

Human Body Model
   The mocap TSV file can also contain joint angles [degrees], joint moments
   [Newton-Meters], joint power [Watts], and muscle forces [Newtons] computed
   by the real time Human Body model. The joint angle headers end in ``.Ang``,
   the joint moments in ``.Mom``, the joint power ``.Pow``, and the muscle
   forces are prefixed with ``R_`` or ``L_``. D-Flow also outputs the centor of
   mass in meters of the person in the ``HBM.COM.[XYZ]`` columns.
Segment Positions and Rotations
   D-Flow also outputs positional and rotational information about body
   segments. There are virtual markers with suffixes ``.Pos[XYZ]`` And there
   are also segment rotations in degrees. These header labels end in
   ``.Rot[XYZ]``. The definition of the positions and rotations is unclear and
   it is unclear what they are used for. The following list gives the prefixes:

   - ``pelvis``
   - ``thorax``
   - ``spine``
   - ``pelvislegs``
   - ``lfemur``
   - ``ltibia``
   - ``lfoot``
   - ``toes``
   - ``rfemur``
   - ``rtibia``
   - ``rfoot``
   - ``rtoes``

   .. todo::
      There are probably more of these for the upper body.

.. [#] Cortex currently does not output anything for the ``.MomY`` momemt on
   both of the force plates. So D-Flow records the raw voltages from Cortex and
   applies the calibration matrix in D-Flow to get correct values using an ``.idc``
   file.

.. [#] We've done independent measurements that show a ~72 millisecond delay.

Missing Values
--------------

D-Flow handles missing values internally to perform well with their real time
computations, but there are some important issues to note when dealing with the
data outputs from D-Flow with regards to missing values. Depending on how many
markers were used, where they were placed, and what analysis is used, different
techniques can be used to fill in the gaps.

Firstly, the markers sometimes go missing (i.e. can't been seen by the cameras)
which is typical of motion capture systems. Care must be taken that all markers
are always captured by the system, but there will always be some missing
values. If the data was recorded in a D-Flow version less than 3.16.2rc4 [#]_,
D-Flow records the last non-missing value in all three axes until the marker is
visible again when a marker goes missing. The following figure gives an
example:

.. image:: constant-markers.png

.. [#] We received versions 3.16.1 and then 3.16.2rc4 so I have no idea when
   the change was introduced between those versions. If this software is used
   with a version between 3.16.1 and 3.16.2c4, then it may or may not work
   correctly.

In D-Flow versions greater than or equal to 3.16.2rc4 the missing markers are
indicated in the TSV file as either ``0.000000`` or ``-0.000000``, which is the
same as has been in the HBM columns in all versions of D-Flow. **The D-Flow
version must be provided in the meta data yml file, otherwise it will assume
D-Flow is at the latest version.**

The mocap output file can also contain variables computed by the real time
implementation of the Human Body Model (HBM). If the HBM computation fails at a
D-Flow sample period, strings of zeros, either ``0.000000`` or ``-0.000000``,
are inserted for missing values. The following figure shows the resulting HBM
output with zeros:

.. image:: hbm-missing.png

Notice that failed HBM computations don't always correspond to missing markers.

The HBM software only handles zero values for marker coordinates. If markers
are zero, then HBM ignores them and tries to compute the inverse dynamics with
a reduced set of markers. So if you playback recordings which have missing
markers stored as constant values in D-Flow, you will likely get incorrect
inverse dynamics.

Time Delays
-----------

There are time delays between the camera marker data, force plate analog
signals, and the wireless EMG/Accelerometers. The documentation for the Delsys
wireless system explicity states that there is a 96ms delay in the data with
respect to the analog signals that are sampled from the unit which is due to
the wireless data transfer. There is also an measurable delay in the camera
data with respect to the analog data which seems to hover around 7 ms.

Other
-----

Note that the order of the "essential" measurements in the file must be
retained if you expect to run the file back into D-Flow for playback. I think
the essential measurements are the time stamp, frame number, marker
coordinates, and force plate kinetics, and analog channels [#]_ (maybe because
of the IDC file).

.. [#] The first twelve analog channels may only be required because we use the
   ``.idc`` file to work around the fact that the ``.MomY`` force plate moments
   are not correctly collected by D-Flow from Cortex.

Inertial Compensation
---------------------

If you accelerate the treadmill there will be forces and moments measured by
the force plates that simply come from the inertial effects of the motion. When
external loads are applied to the force plates, you must subtract these
inertial forces from the measured forces to get correct estimates of the body
fixed externally applied forces.

The markers are measured with respect to the camera's inertial reference frame,
earth, but the treadmill forces are measured with respect to the treadmill's
laterally and rotationally moving reference frame. We need both to be expressed
in the same inertial reference frame for ease of future computations.

To deal with this we measure the location of additional markers affixed to the
treadmill and the 3D acceleration of the treadmill at 4 points.

Typically, the additional accelerometers are connected to these channels and the
arrow on the accelerometers which aligns with the local X axis direction is
always pointing forward (i.e. aligned with the negative z direction).

This information will be stored in the meta data file, see below.

Location of of accels and markers should stay the same between unloaded and
loaded trials, but position doesn't matter other wise.

Record Module
=============

The record module in D-Flow allows one to sample any signal available in the
D-Flow environment at the variable D-Flow sample rate which can vary from 0 to
300 Hz depending on how fast D-Flow is completing it's computations. Any signal
that you desire to record, including the ones already provided in the Mocap
Module, are available. This is particularly useful for measuring the motions of
the treadmill: both belts' speed, lateral motion, and pitching motion. The
record module only outputs a tab delimited text file. It includes a ``Time``
column which records the D-Flow system time in seconds which corresponds to the
same time recorded in the ``TimeStamp`` column in mocap module tsv file. And it
additionally records the 6 decimal precision values of other measurements that
you include. Finally, the record module is capable of recording the time at
which various D-Flow events occur. It does this by inserting commented (#)
lines in between the rows when the event occurred. For example an event may
look like::

   #
   # EVENT A - COUNT 1
   #

Where ``A`` is the event name (fixed by D-Flow, you can't select custom names)
and the number after `COUNT` gives an integer count of how many times that
event has occurred. D-Flow only seems to allow a total of 6 unique events to be
recorded, with names A-F. At the end of the file the total number of event
occurrences are counted::

   # EVENT A occured 1 time
   # EVENT B occured 1 time
   # EVENT C occured 1 time
   # EVENT D occured 1 time
   # EVENT E occured 1 time

Treadmill
---------

The right and left belt speeds can be measured with the record module. You must
select a check box in the treadmill module to ensure that the actual speed is
recorded and not the desired speed. It does not seem possible to measure the
pitch angle nor the lateral position of the treadmill using the record module,
it only records the desired (the input) to each.

Meta Data
=========

D-Flow does not have any way to store meta data with its output. This is
unfortunate because the C3D format has full support for meta data. It is also
possible to add meta data into the header of text files, but it is not the
cleanest solution. So we've implemented our own method to track this
information. The ``DFlowData`` class has the option to include a meta data file
with the other data files that can record arbitrary data about the trial.
Things like subject id, subject body segment parameter info, trial description,
etc can and should be included. This data will be available for output to the
C3D format or other data storage formats and can be used for internal
algorithms in further analysis.

The meta data file must conform to the YAML_ format, which is a common human
readable data serialization format. As time progresses the structure of the
meta data file will become more standard, but for now there are only a few
requirements.

.. _YAML: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

Basics

There are some standard meta data that should be collected with every trial.

study
   id
      Some unique identified for your study.
   name
      A string which contains the name of the project.
   description
      One or more sentences that give a basic description of the project.
subject
    id
        A unique identifier for the subject in this trial. This can be a
        number, a string, etc.
    birth-date
        A date formatted string that gives the subjects birthdate.
    age
        A integer giving the subjects age in years at the time of the trial.
        It's better to provide the subject's birthdate so that the age can be
        computed for the date of the trial.
    mass
        A positive real number giving the subjects weight. Note that actual
        weight on the trial day can likely be computed from the force plate
        data and that should be used for accuracy purposes.
    mass-units
        The full name or standard unit symbol for the mass quantity.
    height
        A positive real number giving the subject's height the day of the
        trial.
    height-units
        The full name or standard unit symbol for the height quantity.
    gender
        A string describing the gender of the subject.
trial
   id
      A unique identifier for this trial. The meta file name should also
      include this identifier.
   datetime
      A date formatted string giving the date and/or time of the trial. If
      you are concerned about the time zone, UTC time is the best to use
      here.
   notes
        A string with a any notes about the trial. The more of this information
        that can be included in structured tags in the meta.yml file the
        better. This should be a catch-all otherwise.
   nominal-speed
      Most trials have a nominal speed throughout the duration of the trial.
      This field can be used to denote that. This is primarily for reference as
      the actual speed can be recorded in D-Flow's record module.
   nominal-speed-units: m/s
      The full name or standard unit symbol for the mass quantity.
   stationary-platform
      A boolean value, [True|False], that indicates whether the treadmill
      motion was actuated during the trial. If this flag is false, the
      DFlowData class will look for compensation data, compensate for the
      inertial affects to the force plate data, and express the forces and
      moments in the motion capture reference frame.
   pitch
      A boolean value, [True|False], which indicates if the pitch degree of
      freedom was acutated during the trial.
   sway
      A boolean value, [True|False], which indicates if the lateral (sway)
      degree of freedom was acutated during the trial.
   marker-set
      A string that indicates the HBM marker set used during the trial
      [full|lower|NA].
   dflow-version
      This should be a string that matches the version of D-Flow used to record
      the trial. This is required to deal with changes in D-Flow's output from
      earlier versions we had.
   cortex-version
      This should be a string that matches the version of Cortex used to record
      the trial.
   hardware-settings
      There are tons of settings for the hardware in both D-Flow, Cortex, and
      the other software in the system. We hope to save the settings from each
      software with each trial, but for now this field can be used to note the
      most important ones.

      high-performance
         A boolean value that indicates whether the D-Flow high performance
         setting was on (True) or off (False).

   files
      This should be a key value mapping of files associated with this trial.
      The values should be the path to the file relative to this meta file.
   marker-map
      If you want to rename the column headers for markers in the mocap module
      or record module's TSV files then you can specify the mapping here. For
      example, if the column headings in the raw data file are ``M5.PosX``,
      ``M5.PosY``, and ``M5.PosZ`` but you want to give the marker an easy to
      remember name, then the marker map ``M5: T10`` will set the column
      headers for that marker to ``T10.PosX``, ``T10.PosY``, and ``T10.PosZ``,
      respectively. This only works for header names that end in ``.Pos[XYZ]``.

Analog Channel Names
--------------------

Since D-Flow doesn't allow you to set the names of the analog channels in the
mocap module, the meta data file should include mappings, so that useful
measurement names will be available for future use, for example::

   trial:
       analog-channel-map:
           Channel1.Anlg: F1Y1
           Channel2.Anlg: F1Y2
           Channel3.Anlg: F1Y3
           Channel4.Anlg: F1X1
           Channel5.Anlg: F1X2
           Channel6.Anlg: F1Z1
           Channel7.Anlg: F2Y1
           Channel8.Anlg: F2Y2
           Channel9.Anlg: F2Y3
           Channel10.Anlg: F2X1
           Channel11.Anlg: F2X2
           Channel12.Anlg: F2Z1
           Channel13.Anlg: Front_Left_EMG
           Channel14.Anlg: Front_Left_AccX
           Channel15.Anlg: Front_Left_AccY
           Channel16.Anlg: Front_Left_AccZ
           Channel17.Anlg: Back_Left_EMG
           Channel18.Anlg: Back_Left_AccX
           Channel19.Anlg: Back_Left_AccY
           Channel20.Anlg: Back_Left_AccZ
           Channel21.Anlg: Front_Right_EMG

           Channel25.Anlg: Back_Right_EMG
           Channel26.Anlg: Back_Right_AccX
           Channel27.Anlg: Back_Right_AccY
           Channel28.Anlg: Back_Right_AccZ

16 accelerometers in order starting at Channel13. EMG, X, Y, Z order

Events
------

D-Flow doesn't allow you to define names to events and auto-names up to 6
events A-F. You can specify an event name map that will be used to
automatically segment your data into more memorable names events::

   trial:
      event:
          A: force plate zeroing begins
          B: walking begins
          C: walking with lateral perturbations begins

Usage
=====

The ``DFlowData`` class is used to post process data collected from the D-Flow
mocap and record modules. It does these operations:

1. Loads the meta data file into a Python dictionary if there is one.
2. Loads the mocap and record modules into Pandas ``DataFrame``\s. [#]_
3. Shifts the Delsys signals in the mocap module data to accomodate for the
   wireless time delay, ~96ms.
4. Identifies the missing values in the mocap marker data and replaces with
   NaN.
5. Returns statistics on how many missing values in the marker time series are
   present, the max consecutive missing values, etc.
6. Optionally, interpolates the missing marker values and replaces them with
   interpolated estimates.
7. Compensates the force measurments for the motion of the treadmill base.

   1. Pulls the compensation file path from meta data.
   2. Loads the compensation file (only the necessary columns).
   3. Identifies the missing markers and interpolates to fill them.
   4. Shifts the Delsys signals to correct time.
   5. Filter the forces, accelerometer, and treadmill markers at 6 hz low pass.
   6. Compute the compensated forces (apply inertial compensation and express
      in global reference frame)
   7. Replace the force/moment measurements in the mocap data file with the
      compensated forces/moments.

8. Scales the analog signals to their proper units. [#]_
9. Merges the data from the mocap module and record module into one
   ``DataFrame``.
10. Optionally, low pass filter all human related data. (If there wasn't a
    stationary platform, then these should always be filtered with the same low
    pass filter as the compensation algorithm used.)
11. Extracts sections of the data based on event names.
12. Writes the cleaned and augmented data to file [#]_.

.. [#] Only supports TSV files, we plan to add C3D support for the mocap file.
.. [#] Not implemented yet, scaling factors should be stored in meta data?.
.. [#] Only outputs to tsv.

Python API
----------

The ``DFlowData`` class gives a simple Python API for working with the
D-Flow file outputs.

::

   from gaitanalysis.motek import DFlowData

   # Initialize the object.
   data = DFlowData(mocap_tsv_path='trial_01_mocap.txt',
                    record_tsv_path='trial_01_record.txt',
                    meta_yml_path='trial_01_meta.yml')

   # clean_data runs through steps 1 through 8. Many steps are optional
   # depending on the optional keyword arguments.
   data.clean_data()

   # The following command returns a Pandas DataFrame of all the measurements
   # for the time period matching the event.
   perturbed_walking = data.extract_processed_data(event='walking with perturbation')

   # The class in includes writers to write the manipulated data to file, in
   # this case a D-Flow compatible text file.
   data.write_dflow_tsv('trial_01_clean.txt')

Command Line
------------

The following command will load the three input files, clean up the data, and
write the results to file, which can be loaded back into D-Flow or used in some
other application.

.. sourcecode:: console

   dflowdata -m trial_01_mocap.txt -r trial_01_record.txt -y trial_01_meta.yml trial_01_clean.txt

Examples
--------

This shows how to compare the raw marker data with the new interpolated data,
in this case a simple linear interpolation.

::

   import pandas
   import maplotlib.pyplot as plt

   data = DFlowData('mocap-module-01.txt', 'record-module-01.txt')
   data.clean_data()

   unclean = pandas.read_csv('mocap-module-01.txt', delimiter='\t')

   fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True)

   for i, label in enumerate(['RHEE.PosX', 'RHEE.PosY', 'RHEE.PosZ']):

      axes[i].plot(data.data['TimeStamp'], data.data[label],
                   unclean['TimeStamp'], unclean[label], '.')

      axes[i].set_ylabel(label + ' [m]')

      axes[i].legend(['Interpolated', 'Raw'], fontsize=8)

   axes[2].set_xlabel('Time')

   fig.show()
