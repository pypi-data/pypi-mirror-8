Gait Module
===========

The :py:mod:`gaitanalysis.gait` module provides tools to process and analyze
with typical data collected during the measurement of human locomotion (gait).
In general, the three dimensional coordinates throughout time of a set of
markers which are attached to anatomical features on the human are tracked.
Secondly, various analog signals are recorded. In particular, voltages which
are proportional to the applied forces and moments on one or two force plates,
voltages from electromyography (EMG) measurements, and/or accelerometers, etc.
All of these measurements are stored as discrete samples in time.
