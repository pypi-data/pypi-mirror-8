------------

Implements the v-statistic, a measure that compares the estimation
accuracy of the ordinary least squares estimator against a random benchmark.

See the paper here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23661222/

I also wrote a Julia version, see [here](https://github.com/dostodabsi/V.jl).
