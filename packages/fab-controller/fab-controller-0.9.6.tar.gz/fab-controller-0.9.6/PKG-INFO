Description: # FAB! The Forgione-Avent-Barber Finger Pressure Stimulator
        
        
        
        ## Hardware
        
        The FAB is based on cheap, readily available hardware (an Arduino microcontroller and widely-available pressure-sensors) and the key mechanical components are 3D printed and can be assembled by lab technicians. Ready-assembled units will also be available to buy.
        
        More details, including circuit diagrams, schematics, and CAD files sufficient to enable 3d-printing and assembly of a device, will be available soon under a permissive open source license.
        
        
        
        ## Software
        
        This repository contains the control software for the new Forgione-Avent-Barber finger pressure stimulator. Details of the original Forgione Barber device [are here](static/ForgioneBarber1971.pdf). The FAB device 
        
        The system includes two software components which communicate via a USB serial link:
        
        - This control software, which runs on a host computer and provides a user interface via a web browser.
        
        - The open source Standard [Firmata](http://firmata.org) firmware, which runs on the embedded controller inside the device. This is pre-installed on ready-assembled devices.
         
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        The software should work on both Mac and PC - the primary dependencies are a recent version of Python plus a C compiler (needed to install the python-gevent library).
        
        
        #### On a Mac, 
        
        1. Install XCode from the Mac App Store (you can skip this if you already have a working C compiler on your system). 
        
        
        2. Open the Terminal app (in the /Applications/Utilities folder).
        
        3. If you don't already have [`pip`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) installed, type:
        
        	`sudo easy_install pip`
        
        And then to install the software:
        
        	`pip install fab-controller`
        	
        
        4. To run the machine, type the command:
        	
            `fab`
        
        This should then show a few initialisation messages, and open a web browser window with the interface to the device.
        
        
        
        Note, log files will be saved into `~/Documents/fab/logs/`
        
        
        
        #### On Windows
        
        1. Ensure you have GCC, Python and pip installed.
        
        2. Repeat the steps above.
