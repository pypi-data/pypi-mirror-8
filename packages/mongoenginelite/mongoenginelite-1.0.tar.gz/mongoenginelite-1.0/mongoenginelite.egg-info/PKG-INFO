Description: mongo_engine_lite
        =================
        MongoEngine Lite helps create a lite version of a Mongo database, similar to SQLite to SQL databases. MongoEngine Lite is a wrapper over MongoEngine ORM and persists the information to a JSON file in the project's root.
        
        To connect to the database, use
        
            from mongoenginelite import connect
        
            connect('dbname')
        
        Documents and EmbeddedDocuments can be used in the same way that MongoEngine does. Nothing else is necessary.
