        Usage:
        ------
        
        - ``pip install django-wiretap``
        - Edit Django settings:
        
           - Add ``'wiretap'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
           - Add ``'wiretap.middleware.WiretapMiddleware'`` to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``.
        
        - Create models with ``./manage.py syncdb``
        - Go to Django admin, add a new ``Tap``.
        
          - This contains a path regex, which is matched against the full path, including the query string
          - If you just want to test Wiretap, set it to ``'/'``.
        
        HTTP request/responses will now be saved to the `Message` admin page.
        
        Note that Wiretap will be disabled if Django is not in debug mode.
