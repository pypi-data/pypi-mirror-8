        Usage:
        ------
        
        - Install the package with ``pip install django-wiretap``
        
        - Edit Django settings:
        
          - Add ``'wiretap'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
          - Add ``'wiretap.middleware.WiretapMiddleware'`` to your
            ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``.
        
        - Create models with ``./manage.py syncdb``
        
        - Go to Django admin, add a new ``Tap``.
        
          - This contains a path `regex <https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions>`_,
            which is matched against the full path including the query string.
        
            - For example, to capture everything within the ``/api/`` path of your site,
              use ``'^/api/'``.
        
            - If you just want to test Wiretap, set it to ``'/'``.
        
        HTTP request/responses will now be saved to the `Message` admin page.
        
        Note that Wiretap will be disabled if Django is not in debug mode.
