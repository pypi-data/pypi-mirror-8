Disclaimer
==========

I am by no way a cobol expert, I just had to work on a cobol project at my
night school with an awful IDE (NetExpress on a Windows Xp virtual machine).

As I was writing pyQode (a code editor widget for python qt applications),
I thought it would be the perfect occasion to show what pyqode can do and write
a simple and lightweight cobol IDE that I could run on my favorite Linux
distribution

I've only learned COBOL 74 and the IDE has been designed with this standard in
mind.

I have no plan on working with cobol at the moment nor to learn
a new standard but if you found a missing feature, feel free to open a feature
request.

I'm always looking forward to make OpenCobolIDE better. Your advice is needed
and will be very appreciated!
