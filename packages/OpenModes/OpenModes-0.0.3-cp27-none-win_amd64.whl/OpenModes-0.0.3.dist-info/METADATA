OpenModes
=========

A Method of Moments (Boundary Element Method) code designed to find the modes
of open resonators such as meta-atoms (the building blocks of metamaterials),
(nano) antennas, scattering particles etc.

Using these modes, broadband models of these elements can be created, enabling
excitation, coupling between them and scattering to be solved easily.

The technique implemented in this code is described in a `published
paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.075108>`_, also available as
an `arXiv preprint <http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3759>`_.

Requires the python packages numpy, scipy and matplotlib, and the free meshing
program gmsh. See the `documentation <http://www.pythonhosted.org/OpenModes/>`_ 
for full installation instructions and requirements.

The source is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/DavidPowell/OpenModes>`_,
and binary packages are available from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/OpenModes>`_.

This program was written by David Powell, a research fellow with the Nonlinear
Physics Centre at the Australian National University. Contact details are available
on my `web page <http://wwwrsphysse.anu.edu.au/nonlinear/people/DavidPowell.shtml>`_.
