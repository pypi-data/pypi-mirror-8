1. INSTALLATION

1.1 REQUISITES

IM is based on python, so Python 2.4 or higher runtime and standard library must
be installed in the system.

It is also required to install the Python Lex & Yacc library (http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/).
It is available in all of the main distributions as 'python-ply' package.

1.2 OPTIONAL PACKAGES

In case of using the SSL secured version of the XMLRPC API the SpringPython
framework (http://springpython.webfactional.com/) must be installed.

1.3 INSTALLING

You only need to install the tar-gziped file to any directoy:

$ tar xvzf IM-client-X.XX.tar.gz

1.4 CONFIGURATION

Adjust the parameters in $CLIENT_PATH/config.py. Please pay attention to the next 
configuration variables, as they are the most important

CLIENT_DIR - must be set to the full path where the IM client is installed 
            (e.g. /usr/local/im-client)
         
1.4.1 SECURITY

Security is disabled by default, but it should be taken into account that it would
be possible that someone that has local network access can "sniff" the traffic and
get the messages with the IM with the authorisation data with the cloud providers.

I can be activated both in the XMLRPC and REST APIs. Setting this variables:

XMLRCP_SSL = True

And then set the variables: XMLRCP_SSL_CA_CERTS to your CA certificates paths.
