Description: 
        # Mandrel (python-mandrel) #
        
        Mandrel provides bootstrapping and configuration tools for consistent,
        straightforward project config management.
        
        Use Mandrel to:
        
        * bootstrap your python project configuration
        * manage configuration file location/access
        * manage logging configuration and Logger retrieval
        
        Separate projects can rely on Mandrel for these purposes, and when they're
        brought together (as eggs, for instance) to a single application, their
        configuration can be managed simply in an easily-configurable way.
