Migrating from RelStorage version 1.1.1 to version 1.1.2

Before following these directions, first upgrade to the schema of
RelStorage version 1.1.1 by following the directions in "migrate-to-1.1.1.txt".

Only Oracle needs a schema update for this release:

    DROP TABLE temp_pack_visit;
    CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp_pack_visit (
        zoid        NUMBER(20) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        keep_tid    NUMBER(20)
    );
