v1.0 (2014-12-10)
==================

- Added MWPotential2014: a Milky-Way-like potential fit to a bunch of
  relevant data on the Milky Way; supersedes MWPotential, which is
  still included; changed many examples to use this new potential;

- Changed default integrator to symplec4_c;

- Changed default vo and ro to 220 km/s and 8 kpc, respectively;

- Allow Orbit initialization to specify a distance and velocity scale
  that is then used to output distances, velocities, energies,
  actions, etc. in physical coordinates;

- Added an orbit-fitting routine (Orbit.fit).

- Added virial radius of NFW potential, allow initialization of NFW
  potential with concentration and mass;

- Added potential.mass to return the mass enclosed for individual
  potential instances; both spherical and axisymmetric potentials are
  covered.

- Sped up many of the functions in galpy.util.bovy_coords by removing
  scipy.frompyfunc dependency;

- Added galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_gevcc,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.force_in_10m13kms2,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_criticaldens,
  galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_meanmatterdens.

- Much improved test coverage.

- Added planarPotential.LinShuReductionFactor to calculate the
  reduction factor for the response of a kinematically warm population
  to a spiral perturbation.

- Added non-axisymmetric DFs to the top-level and the documentation.

- New streamdf track calculation (see arXiv_v2/published version of
  Bovy 2014); better handdling of coordinate-transformation
  parameters in streamdf.

- Installation now prints informative message about whether or not the
  C extensions were installed.

- More informative warning messages when C functions are not used.

- Fix issues with non-square grids in the C implementation of
  interpRZPotential.

- Added Orbit.flip to generate new Orbit instances with flipped
  velocities.

- Improved actionAngle frequencies for circular orbits.

- Removed actionAngleFlat and actionAnglePower, because they are
  superseded.

- Added hasC_dxdv member to Potential instances to indicate whether or
  not they can be used with integrate_dxdv

- Add C implementation of PowerSphericalPotentialwCutoff;

- Moved MovingObjectPotential, BurkertPotential, and interpRZPotential
  to top level; better implementation of interpRZPotential;

- Better handling of vo,ro, and solarmotion in Orbit instances (Orbit
  initialization value is now used to generate RA, Dec, etc. outputs);

- Added --no-openmp installation option to allow installation without
  OpenMP support (workaround for clang not supporting OpenMP; not
  necessary anymore);
