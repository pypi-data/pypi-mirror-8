        CONTRIBUTING TO GALPY
        ----------------------
        
        Some development notes can be found on the `wiki
        <http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/>`__. This includes a list of
        small and larger extensions of galpy that would be useful `here
        <http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Possible-galpy-extensions>`__ as
        well as a longer-term roadmap `here
        <http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Roadmap>`__. Please let the main
        developer know if you need any help contributing!
        
        DISK DF CORRECTIONS
        --------------------
        
        The dehnendf and shudf disk distribution functions can be corrected to
        follow the desired surface-mass density and radial-velocity-dispersion
        profiles more closely (see `1999AJ....118.1201D
        <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AJ....118.1201D>`__). Calculating
        these corrections is expensive, and a large set of precalculated
        corrections can be found `here
        <http://github.com/downloads/jobovy/galpy/galpy-dfcorrections.tar.gz>`__
        \[tar.gz archive\]. Install these by downloading them and unpacking them into the galpy/df_src/data directory before running the setup.py installation. E.g.,
        
        .. code-block:: none
        
           curl -O https://cloud.github.com/downloads/jobovy/galpy/galpy-dfcorrections.tar.gz
           tar xvzf galpy-dfcorrections.tar.gz -C ./galpy/df_src/data/
