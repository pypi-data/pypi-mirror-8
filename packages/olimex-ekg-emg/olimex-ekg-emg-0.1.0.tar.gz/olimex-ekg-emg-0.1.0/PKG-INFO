Description: olimex-ekg-emg
        ==============
        
        |docs|
        
        A Python package for gathering and viewing data from the `Olimex EKG/EMG Shield`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install olimex-ekg-emg
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            >>> from olimex.gui import show_exg
            >>> show_exg('/path/to/port')
        
        Replace ``'/path/to/port'`` with the path to the port to which your Arduino is connected.
        
        A `matplotlib figure`_ should appear and a real-time wave form should begin go to be drawn.
        Calibration of the waveform within the figure make take up to 10 seconds.
