Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.inviting is an add-on for Plone that manages event invitations, 
        confirmations, and attendance as stored, indexed relationships between
        users (members or guests) and event content items in a Plone site.
        
        This package provides the following features:
        
         * Allow event content owners to manage invitations and retrospectively
           track attendance and confirmations (RSVPs).
        
         * Email invitations including iCal, vCal attachments and links to
           return to the event to confirm/RSVP.
        
         * Support both site members and guests (identifying with email) as 
           parties who can be invited.
        
         * Builds upon collective.subscribe, a general purpose set of components
           for managing user relationships ("subscriptions") with content.
        
         * Users can change their confirmation status by re-visiting the
           confirmation link.
        
         * A simple hash/token is included in emailed URLs to prevent abuse.
        
         * Provides utility and adapter registrations for components in
           collective.subscribe for use in a Plone site.
        
        Depends on collective.subscribe.
