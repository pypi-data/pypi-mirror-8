Swapper
=======

Django Swappable Models - No longer only for auth.User!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Swapper is an unofficial API for the
`undocumented <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/19103>`__ but very
powerful Django feature: swappable models. Swapper facilitates
implementing arbitrary swappable models in your own reusable apps.

|Build Status|

Tested on Python 2.7 and 3.4, with Django 1.6 and 1.7.

Example Use Case
----------------

Suppose your reusable app has two related tables:

.. code:: python

    from django.db import models
    class Parent(models.Model):
        name = models.TextField()

    class Child(models.Model):
        name = models.TextField()
        parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent)

Suppose further that you want to allow the user to subclass either or
both of these models and supplement them with their own implementations.
You could use Abstract classes (e.g. ``BaseParent`` and ``BaseChild``)
for this, but then you would either need to:

1. Avoid putting the foreign key on ``BaseChild`` and tell the user they
   need to do it.
2. Put the foreign key on ``BaseChild``, but make ``Parent`` a concrete
   model that can't be swapped
3. Use swappable models, together with ``ForeignKeys`` that read the
   swappable settings.

This third approach is taken by Django to facilitate `swapping the
auth.User
model <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#auth-custom-user>`__.
Swapper extends this approach to apply to any model.

Getting Started
---------------

.. code:: bash

    pip install swapper

Usage
-----

Extending the above example, create abstract base classes and default
implementations:

.. code:: python

    # reusableapp/models.py
    from django.db import models
    from swapper import swappable_setting, get_model_name

    class BaseParent(models.Model):
        # minimal base implementation ...
        class Meta:
            abstract = True

    class Parent(BaseParent):
        # default (swappable) implementation ...
        class Meta:
           swappable = swappable_setting('reusableapp', 'Parent')

    class BaseChild(models.Model):
        parent = models.ForeignKey(get_model_name('reusableapp', 'Parent'))
        # minimal base implementation ...
        class Meta:
            abstract = True

    class Child(BaseChild):
        # default (swappable) implementation ...
        class Meta:
           swappable = swappable_setting('reusableapp', 'Child')

Then the user can override one or both models in their own app:

.. code:: python

    # myapp/models.py
    from reusableapp.models import BaseParent
    class Parent(BaseParent):
        # custom implementation ...

The user then specifies the appropriate setting to trigger the swap:

.. code:: python

    # myproject/settings.py
    REUSABLEAPP_PARENT_MODEL = "myapp.Parent"

Note: Instead of importing concrete models directly, always use the
swapper:

.. code:: python

    # reusableapp/views.py

    # Might work, might not
    # from .models import Parent

    from swapper import load_model
    Parent = load_model("reusableapp", "Parent")
    Child = load_model("reusableapp", "Parent")

    def view(request, *args, **kwargs):
        qs = Parent.objects.all()
        # ...

Real-World Example
------------------

Swapper is used extensively in `wq.db <http://wq.io/wq.db>`__,
particularly in the `vera <http://wq.io/vera>`__ submodule, which has no
less than `7 inter-related
models <https://github.com/wq/wq.db/blob/master/contrib/vera/models.py>`__,
each of which can be swapped out for custom implementations. (Swapper
actually started out as part of
`wq.db.patterns <http://wq.io/docs/about-patterns>`__, but was extracted
for more general-purpose use.)
