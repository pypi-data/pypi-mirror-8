                ========================
        
                General
                -------
        
                Queryset Iterator is a tool that is useful for iterating over large data-sets
                in Django.
        
                Queryset Iterator iterates over large data-sets in batches, which can be
                manually set to any batch size of your choosing, to improve performance.
                The iterator maintains an open database cursor to a median table containing
                only the primary keys of the results that would normally be obtained. Due to
                this, primary keys must be unique within the collection and this tool will
                not work should primary keys be non-unique within the database query results.
