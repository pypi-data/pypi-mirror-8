Description:           Library for inversion counting which can adjust for ties and censored data
                 (e.g. left censored, right censored, etc). The intention of this library is
                 to examine the distance from the sequence of elements to some reference sequence.
                 It is also calculates an exact PMF of the distribution for inversion counts under
                 the case where all permutations are equally likely, as well as a normal approximation
                 for this same distribution.  Wilcoxan and sign tests are provided for hypothesis testing,
                 where a group of permutations are compared against a single reference sequence.  This
                 sort of testing would be needed for situations where a distribution of collected
                 sequences might be compared against a "known correct" reference sequence.
