            <p>This example shows how to use the Styler ux to change the style of a feature. The Styler is made of 2 parts:
             <ul><li>The LayerStyleManager</li><li>A Styler</li></ul></p>

            <p><b>LayerStyleManager:</b> This object is a manager that provides methods to set the current layer and/or current feature(s) being worked on. This manager contains Events that are fired when a style is changed. This object take the style from returned by the Styler and apply it to the layer or feature. </p>

            <p><b>Styler:</b> The Styler object is the type of styler displayed by the LayerStyleManager. This UX can contains many different stylers, from the simple style list in a combobox to a full fledged filter builder that includes a complex style creation tool. The only requirement is for the Styler to have a <u>createLayout</u> method that returns a ExtJS component and a <u>change</u> event that is used to return the Style or Rule to apply to the layer(s) or feature(s). </p>

            <p>By using this concept, we could have many different representation of the Styler (complex, simple, with rules or not, etc.) and always use the same LayerStyleManager object to interact with them.</p>
