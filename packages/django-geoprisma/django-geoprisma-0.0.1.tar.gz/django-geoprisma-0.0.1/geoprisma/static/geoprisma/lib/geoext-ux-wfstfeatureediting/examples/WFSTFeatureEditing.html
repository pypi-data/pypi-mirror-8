    <h1>WFSTFeatureEditing ux</h1>
    <p>
      This widget automatically creates all the tools required to accomplish
      WFST  editing using GeoExt. See
      <a href="WFSTFeatureEditing.js">WFSTFeatureEditing.js</a> for the source
      code of this example.
    </p>
    <div id="content"></div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Most of the components are created asynchronously using WFS requests.
      A GetCapabilities request is used to create the vector layers and
      a DescribeFeatureType one is used to get the fields and the geometry type.
      From there, DrawFeature, SelectFeature and many other controls and widgets
      are automatically created for each layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one layer can be edited at a time in one of the following mode :
      <b>draw</b> or <b>edit</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'edit' mode can either use a 'filter' mode or not.  This demo uses the
      filter mode.  Enabling the 'edit' mode on a layer doesn't show the
      features yet.  You need to draw a box on the map to get the features
      first, then click on the feature you wish to edit.  You can also select it
      from the grid on the left of the window that pops up when you select a
      feature.  If only one feature was
      returned by box you drawn, it's automatically selected.  The
      "Return to selection" button clears the features that were returned by the
      box and reenable the box selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      While creating vector layers with a WFS protocol, if a WMS layer having
      the same name present in the map, it will be automatically refreshed upon
      each modifications and also automatically shown when editing is enabled on
      its WFS counterpart.  These features are shown in this demo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widget has an 'ignoreAttributes' property that can be set to a list
      of fields we don't want to be displayed in both grids.  This feature is
      shown in this demo some user-specific fields are not shown in both grids.
    </p>
