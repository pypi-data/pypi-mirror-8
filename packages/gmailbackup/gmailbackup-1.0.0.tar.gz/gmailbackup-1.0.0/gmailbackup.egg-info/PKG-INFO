Description: # Gmail Backup
        
        This is a small command-line tool that backs up your Gmail.
        It downloads your email messages as [RFC822](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/) format *.eml text files, which are compatible with most email clients.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        This requires Python 2.7.
        You can install dependencies using this command:
        
            pip install gmailbackup
        
        
        ## Command Line Usage
        
        Download all email messages into the "email" directory:
        
            gmailbackup -u <username> -p <password>
        
        Download all email messages labeled "foo" and "bar" into their own subdirectories under "mydir":
        
            gmailbackup -u <username> -p <password> -l foo,bar -o mydir
        
        ## Python Usage
        
        To get started, use the `GmailClient` class in a `with` statement, authenticate it, then iterate any mailbox (label) you'd like.
        The `GmailClient` is a simple wrapper around the IMAP4 client.
        
        	from gmailbackup import GmailClient
        	
        	with GmailClient() as client:
        		client.authentiate('me@gmail.com', 'mypassword')
        		client.save_mailbox('Some Label', 'path/to/downloads')
