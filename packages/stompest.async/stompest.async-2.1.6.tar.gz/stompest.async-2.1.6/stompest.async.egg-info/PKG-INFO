Description: stomp, stomper, stompest!
        =========================
        
        This package provides the asynchronous STOMP client based upon the `stompest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stompest/>`_ library. It leverages the power of `Twisted <http://twistedmatrix.com/>`_, a very mature and powerful asynchronous programming framework. The client supports destination specific message and error handlers (with default "poison pill" error handling), concurrent message processing, graceful shutdown, and connect, receipt, and disconnect timeouts.

        Acknowledgements
        ================
        * Version 1.x of stompest was written by `Roger Hoover <http://github.com/theduderog/>`_ at `Mozes <http://www.mozes.com/>`_ and deployed in their production environment.
        * Kudos to `Oisin Mulvihill <https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/>`_, the developer of `stomper <http://code.google.com/p/stomper/>`_! The idea of an abstract representation of the STOMP protocol lives on in stompest.
