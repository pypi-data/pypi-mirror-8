pyflapjackevents
================

pyflapjackevents is a small library that serializes `flapjack <http://flapjack.io>`_ events as described in it's own `Data structures <http://flapjack.io/docs/1.0/development/DATA_STRUCTURES/>`_. It's main intention is to allow sending monitor events to flapjack from python programs.


An example:

.. code-block:: python

    server = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port='6380')
    sink = FlapjackEventSink(server, 'events')
    event = FlapjackEvent(
        'test-entity',
        'test-check',
        FlapjackEvent.EVENT_SERVICE,
        FlapjackEvent.STATE_OK,
        summary = 'test-summary',
        details = 'test-details',
    )
    sink.send(event)



This would serialize the event and send it to the appropriate Redis channel for flapjack consumption.
