`formatter2` is a Python formatter based on the `tokenize` library in Python.
Due to a bug with line continuations we are currently running a fork of the
`tokenize` library however.

During every format sequence the `compile` method is used to check if no code
has been broken, but backing up is still a good idea.

The library is made to be very extendable and configurable but it's still in 
the beginning phase. Eventually this will become a fully featured formatting 
tool for Python.

Install
-------

To install simply execute `python setup.py install` or `pip install
formatter2`.
If you want to run the tests first, run `nosetests`

Usage
-----

To format all of your code recursively (MAKE BACKUPS!):

    python-formatter -r DIRECTORY

Or:

    format-python -r DIRECTORY
