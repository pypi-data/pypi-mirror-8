Currently the tests are passing on OS X on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3.

On Linux they are currently failing with ImportErrors for test.support when the
test suite is run with:

    $ python setup.py test

which uses the unittest module's test discovery mechanism.

These same tests pass when running the test suite with:

    $ py.test
