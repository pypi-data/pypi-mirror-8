pasteurize.py
=============

This script is only used by the unit tests. Another script called "pasteurize"
is created automatically (without the .py extension) by setuptools.

pasteurize.py attempts to turn Py3 code into relatively clean Py3 code that is
also compatible with Py2 when using the ``future`` package.
