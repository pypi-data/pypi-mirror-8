Description: Aiourlstatus
        ============
        
        A link checker that checks the urls in text files - using Python 3.4 and asyncio.
        
        This used to be called alinkcheck, but I changed the name to avoid confusion
        with another program.
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Aiourlstatus can be used as a command line application, or it can be imported and
        called from an interactive python, or ipython, shell.
        
        Aiourlstatus parses text files, and then checks all the urls it finds.
        It can be used, for example, to check the links in files output by databases.
        
        The links are checked asynchronously, so the program does not block while waiting for responses.
        However, the number of times each domain is checked is limited.
        This means that aiourlstatus will run slower if the links you are checking are from
        a small number of domains.
