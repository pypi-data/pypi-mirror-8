       * Operations MENU:

           * Equation-Set

               specify equation for old or new data column

           * Analog to Digital

               create new data column which is the bus value of a set of
               bus bits, which are sliced from analog values to digital
               values.

           * Add delineator

               add a delineator column, which toggles from a very low
               value to a very high value, whenever another column changes
               value.

           * \-x
