**Installing DeCiDa**
=====================

Download and prepare the distribution
-------------------------------------

* unzip/untar the distribution::

    tar xvfz DeCiDa.1.0.2-tar.gz

* cd into the distribution directory::

    cd DeCiDa-1.0.2

* you may want to install the DeCiDa html documentation (in ./doc/html)
  to an appropriate place for future reference.
  use a browser to read the documentation, using the url file:// specification
  to point to the index.html file in the html directory.

* manually modify the wrapper scripts in the distribution
  ./etc/wrapper directory (run_*), to point to correct tool locations.
  
  The wrappers have the following references to other tools.  
  Adjust these as needed, as required by your local environment.

+----------------+-------------------------------+
| wrapper:       | expected tool location:       |
+================+===============================+
| run_hspice     | /tools/hspice/bin/hspice      |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| run_ngspice    | /opt/local/bin/ngspice        |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| run_sspice     | /tools/silvaco/bin/sspice     |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| run_spectre    | /tools/cds/bin/spectre        |
+----------------+-------------------------------+

Installing under Enthought Canopy
---------------------------------

* install in the Canopy Python User Virtual Environment

    refer to: `Installing packages into Canopy <https://support.enthought.com/entries/23389761-Installing-packages-into-Canopy-User-Python-from-the-command-line/>`_, `Canopy python default <https://support.enthought.com/entries/23646538-Make-Canopy-s-Python-be-your-default-Python-i-e-on-the-PATH->`_

* be sure that User python is in your path::

    python
    >>> import sys; sys.prefix

  you should see a path like one of the following::

    /Users/<user>/Library/Enthought/Canopy_32bit/User (MacOs)

    /home/<user>/Enthought/Canopy_32bit/User (Linux)


* install the distribution::

    python setup.py install

* you will find a new directory .DeCiDa in your home directory containing
  various tool specific scripts, models and other data

* the DeCiDa libraries are installed under site-packages

* the DeCiDa applications are installed in the python bin directory
  so they should be in the user path (may require a shell rehash)

Installing under (2.7) python
-----------------------------

* be sure that python2.7 is in your path::

    python
    >>> import sys; sys.prefix

  you should see a path like one of the following::

    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7 (MacOS)

    /opt/local/lib/python2.7 (Linux)

* install the distribution::

    python setup.py install

Installing as a local library
-----------------------------

* DeCiDa can also be installed in a user's directory without requiring sysadmin
  privileges.

* select or make a directory for putting python libraries::

    mkdir ~/python/library

* copy the decida library to the python library in your home directory::

    cp -R ./decida ~/python/library

* edit the python resource file in ./etc/dot (.pythonrc.py).
  change the pylib definition appropriately to point to ~/python/library

* copy the resource file to your home directory::

    cp ./etc/dot/.pythonrc.py ~/.

* to use decida, import the user package, which imports ~/.pythonrc.py::

    >>> import user

* alternatively, define the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include
  ~/python/library in the path

* copy the applications to the user home bin directory::

    cp ./bin/* ~/bin

Test the distribution using the distribution tests
--------------------------------------------------

* test the distribution with one or more individual tests::

    python
    >>> import decida.test.test_Calc

  should display a calculator

    >>> import decida.test.test_Plotterx

  should display a plot and equation-set text-window

* list all of the tests::

     python
     >>> import decida.test
     >>> decida.test.test_list()

  should print all of the tests

* do all of the tests::

     python
     >>> import decida.test_all

  this may or may not complete depending on the sequence of closing windows

* the tests can also be run directly in the unzipped/tarred (pre-install) directory::

     cd DeCiDa-1.0.2/decida/test
     test_DataViewx_4.py

* test the applications installed in the python bin::

     twin

  should display a text-window (text-editor)
