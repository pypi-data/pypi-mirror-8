  dataview help
  
  Scripting example:

  The dataview window can be started up in a decida script
  or directly in interactive mode.

  The following example reads the file "vco.raw" into a 
  decida data object.
  The DataViewx parameter command is a list of plots to be made.
  In the example, two plots are made. The first plot is
  VINM, VINP, and VOUT versus TIME.
  The second plot is VINM, VINP, and VCK versus TIME, where VCK is
  stacked above the bottom plots (-stack and -overlay are keywords).
  The second list element in each plot is XYplotx arguments.

  d = Data()
  d.read("vco.raw")
  DataViewx(d, command=[
      ["TIME VINM VINP VOUT", "ymin=0"],
      ["TIME VINM VINP -stack VCK", "ymin=0"],
  ])
