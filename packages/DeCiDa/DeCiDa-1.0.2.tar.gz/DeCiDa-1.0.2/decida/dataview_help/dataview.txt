 File MENU:
   % Read Data File
       display file browser to select data file to read
   % Write column format
       writes current working data set to a file in column-oriented format
   % Write advplot format
       writes current working data set to a file in advplot format
   % Print all plots
       prints all notebook pages
   % Accept Data
       working data set copied to main data set
   % Restore Data
       main data set copied to working data set
   % Re-order data
       specify columns for re-ordering data set
   % Close
       close dataview window, do not exit decida
   % Exit Decida
       exit decida
 Analysis MENU:
   % Statistics
       print time,signal statistics
   % Duty-cycle
       open new dataview window with duty-cycle, frequency, period
       versus time.
   % FFT
       Fourier transform.
   % IFFT
       Inverse Fourier transform.
   % Jitter
       clock jitter calculation and dataview window with jitter vs time, etc.
   % Time-Constant
       calculate time-constant from exponential curve.
 X: Y:
   % select current XCOL and current YCOL
 RED BUTTONS:
   % Start
       plots YCOL_vs_XCOL curve
   % Overlay
       plots YCOL_vs_XCOL curve on current plot, overlayed
   % Stack
       plots YCOL_vs_XCOL curve on current plot, stacked above last curve
   % Next
       starts new notebook page and plots YCOL_vs_XCOL curve
   % Delete
       deletes current notebook page
 MOUSE on plot:
   % button 1: zoom-in
       Pressing down button 1 starts a zoom-in operation.  Holding button 1 
       down and moving to new location displays a zoom-in box with endpoints
       at original location and current location.  Releasing button 1
       changes axes limits of graph to those of the zoom-in box.
   % button 2: restore
       Pressing down button 2 returns axes limits to the original ones.
   % button 3: line parameter report
       Pressing down button 3 starts a line-segment operation for reporting
       slope and intercepts.  Holding down, moving, then releasing define a
       line-segment.  After release, a report of the line-parameters of the
       defined line segment: slope, y-intercept, x-intercept.
       For a single press and release, only x and y are reported.
   % shift-button 3: curve label operation
       Pressing down button 3 with shift held down starts a curve-label
       operation.  Holding down, moving, then releasing defines a
       line-segment.  After release, prompt for text for the label, and 
       whether or not to add an arrow.
   % shift-button 1: delete curve label operation
       Pressing down button 3 with shift held down starts a delete
       curve-label operation.  Holding down, moving, then releasing
       defines a delete box.  After release, any markers within the
       delete box are removed.
   % control-button 3: data removal operation
       Pressing down button 3 with control held down starts a data removal
       operation.  Holding down, moving, then releasing defines a
       delete box (red).  After release, any data points (XCOL, YCOL)
       are deleted from the working data set.

 MOUSE on note-book tab:
   % button 1: select page
       Button 1 selects notebook page connected to the tab.
   % button 3: lift off page
       Button 3 lifts the notebook page out of the notebook into a new
       window.
       Deleting the new window returns the plot to the notebook.
