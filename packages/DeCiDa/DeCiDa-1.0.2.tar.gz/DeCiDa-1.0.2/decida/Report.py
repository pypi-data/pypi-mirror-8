class Report :
    """ format and report data.

    **synopsis**:

    Report manages a reporting scheme where data is to be written to a file
    in column-oriented format.  The format is space-separated values, but
    an additional comma-separated values format file can also be written.
    The Report *header* method specifies the names of the data columns.
    After each set of values (one value for each data column) is written
    to the file, the file is flushed.
    
    **constructor arguments**:

        .. option:: filename (string)

            name of report file to generate.

        .. option:: format (string) (optional, default=None)

            format string for report values.  If None, then report items
            are formatted as float.

        .. option:: comment_char (string) (optional, default="#")

            character(s) to prepend to comments.

        .. option:: verbose (boolean) (optional, default=False)

            if true, print each report line to stdout.

        .. option:: csv (boolean) (optional, default=False)

            if true, report to a csv file.

    **results**:

        * if file already exists, move to file.bak

        * reports header, followed by reported lines, formated
          by the report format

    **example**:

        >>> from decida.Report import Report
        >>> rpt = Report("example1.txt", verbose=True)
        >>> rpt.header("time vscl")
        >>> for i in range(0, 20):
        >>>    t = i*1e-3/20
        >>>    v = 1.2 + 2.4*t + 840.0*t*t
        >>>    rpt.report(t, v)
