def multiline(line, linelength=72):

    **arguments**:
        .. option:: line (string)

            line to be split up

        .. option:: linelength (optional, default=72)

            maximum length of returned lines

    **results**:

        * line split on spaces or tabs

        * return list of lines of max length linelength

    **example**:

            >>> import decida
            >>> text = \"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\"
            >>> lines = decida.multiline(text, 60)
            >>> print string.join(lines, \"\\n\")
