def baseconvert(base_from, base_to, number, digits=None) :
    """ convert number in one base to another.

    **arguments**:

        .. option:: base_from (int)

            number is represented in this base

        .. option:: base_to (int)

            output is to be represented in this base

        .. option:: number (string)

            input number represented in base base_from

        .. option:: digits (int) (optional, default=None)

            if specified, and output string is shorter than digits,
            fill with zeros until output string is digits long

    **result**:

            return string representation of number in base base_to

    **examples**:

            >>> import decida
            >>> decida.baseconvert(16, 10, "1242")
            '74562'

            >>> import decida
            >>> decida.baseconvert(10, 16, "113", 4)
            '0071'

    **notes**:

            string.atoi(number, base) converts base 10 number to other base
