        grr is a simple utility to make using Gerrit a little less painful.
        
        The basic workflow involves using a detached head, and pulling down changes from gerrit to
        work on them, and re-submitting them. Inspired by git-review, grr reads from .gitreview files
        and will try to use your gitreview.username setting.
        
        Installation: pip install grr
        
        
        * grr init: Adds a `gerrit` remote and installs the commit-msg hook
        * grr fetch 12345[:2]: Pulls change 12345. An optional patchset # can be specified, otherwise the latest will be used.
        * grr pull [master]: Pulls the latest remote changes and checks out the given branch, defaults to master.
        * grr checkout [master]: Checkout the given branch, defaults to master
        * grr review [branch]: Uploads your patches for review, the branch defaults to master.
        * grr [branch]: Shorthand for `grr review`.
