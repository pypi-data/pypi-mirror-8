Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This is a rendering server that will wrap an OpenOffice/LibreOffice server and provide
        a pythonic API which is remotely callable.
        
        The main advantage is that your client code does not need to import pyuno... This
        is a main plus because pyuno is a pain to get working on Windows and some flavors of
        Linux, don't even think of Mac :)
        
        Once you deploy a py3o.renderserver all you need in your python code is to use the
        `py3o.renderclient`_ which is really straightforward...
        
          .. _py3o.renderclient http://bitbucket.org/faide/py3o.renderclient
        
        Deployment
        ==========
        
        We recommend you use the dockerized versions from the `dockerhub`_ .
        
          .. _dockerhub: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/xcgd/py3oserver-docker/
        
        Using this way you'll get the latest tested version of LibreOffice and py3o.renderserver without the hassle of building all the dependencies...
        
        Manual Installation
        ===================
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install the latest JDK for your plateform. Here is an example for Ubuntu (13.04 or 14.04)::
        
          apt-get install default-jdk
        
        This will give you the necessary tools to compile the juno driver.
        
        You will need to install (and compile) the `py3o.renderers.juno`_ driver.
        
          .. _py3o.renderers.juno: http://bitbucket.org/faide/py3o.renderers.juno
        
        Follow the instructions from the driver's documentation to install it and then you're ready to start your own RenderServer
        
        Running the server
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here is how we start the server on a Linux host (Ubuntu 13.04)::
        
          $ start-py3o-renderserver --java=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so --ure=/usr/lib --office=/usr/lib/libreoffice --driver=juno --sofficeport=8997
        
        You MUST have a  running LibreOffice (OpenOffice) server somewhere. In our example it is running on localhost with port 8997. Here is how you can start such a server on Linux (Ubuntu 13.04 / LibreOffice 4.0.4)::
        
          $ libreoffice --nologo --norestore --invisible --headless --nocrashreport --nofirststartwizard --nodefault --accept="socket,host=localhost,port=8997;urp;"
        
        As you can see it works with OpenJDK, LibreOffice and even on 64bit systems :)
