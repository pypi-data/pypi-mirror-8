** ABOUT **

SàT PubSub is a XMPP PubSub service component (XEP-0060)
It's based on Ralph Meijer's Idavoll, but provide special features necessary for the « Salut à Toi » project ( http://sat.goffi.org ), but it can also be used for any other XMPP project.
The use of a standard external component allow to use this features with most XMPP servers.
One of the main addition is fine access tuning for PubSub, which allow the publication of items for only some groups, even if the entire node is open. The protocol is explained on http://www.goffi.org/post/2012/06/24/Fine-access-tuning-for-PubSub for the moment, and a protoxep should be proposed to the XSF in the future...
