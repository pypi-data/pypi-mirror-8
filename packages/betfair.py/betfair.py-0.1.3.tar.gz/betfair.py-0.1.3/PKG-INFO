        betfair.py is a Python wrapper for the Betfair API
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install betfair.py
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python >= 2.7 or >= 3.3
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To run tests ::
        
            $ py.test
        
        SSL Certificates
        ----------------
        
        For non-interactive login, you must generate a self-signed SSL certificate
        and upload it to your Betfair account. Betfair.py includes tools for
        simplifying this process. To create a self-signed certificate, run ::
        
            invoke ssl
        
        This will generate a file named ``betfair.pem`` in the ``certs`` directory.
        You can write SSL certificates to another directory by passing the
        ``--name`` parameter ::
        
            invoke ssl --name=path/to/certs/ssl
        
        This will generate a file named ``ssl.pem`` in the ``path/to/certs/``
        directory. Once you have generated the SSL certificate, you can upload the
        .pem file to Betfair at https://myaccount.betfair.com/accountdetails/mysecurity?showAPI=1.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Create a Betfair client and log in ::
        
            from betfair import Betfair
            client = Betfair('test', 'certs/betfair.pem')
            client.login('username', 'password')
        
        Refresh session token ::
        
            client.keep_alive()
        
        Log out ::
        
            client.logout()
        
        List all tennis markets ::
        
            from betfair.models import MarketFilter
            event_types = client.list_event_types(
                MarketFilter(text_query='tennis')
            )
            print(len(event_types))                 # 1
            print(event_types[0].event_type.name)   # 'Tennis'
            tennis_event_type = event_types[0]
            markets = client.list_market_catalogue(
                MarketFilter(event_type_ids=[tennis_event_type.event_type.id])
            )
            markets[0].market_name                  # 'Djokovic Tournament Wins'
