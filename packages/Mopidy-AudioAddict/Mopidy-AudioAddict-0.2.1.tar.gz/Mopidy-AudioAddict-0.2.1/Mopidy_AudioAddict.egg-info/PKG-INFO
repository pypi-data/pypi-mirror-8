Description: Installation
        ============
        
        Install by running the following:
        
          python setup.py install
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Make sure you enable the extension after you've completed the installation. You will also
        need the Mopidy-Stream extension enabled - it's bundled with Mopidy, so unless you disabled it
        it should be available.
        
        You may change prefered quality in your Mopidy configuration file. An example configuration is
        included in the ext.conf file.
        
        If you have an AudioAddict premium account, fill in your API key. This will allow you to use the 
        higher quality streams as usual on all the network sites.
        
        For quality you can pick between 40k, 64k, 128k and 320k
