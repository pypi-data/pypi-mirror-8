Description: 
        txt2boil
        ========
        
        This is a boilerplate generator that generates code based on the
        comments it finds in source code.  
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        The motivation is that ordinary boilerplate generators either require
        you to hack the build system you're using (to build the source code on
        the fly) or you statically generate the boiler plate (and are then
        unable to modify it or generate more without pulling together the
        script that first generated it).
        
        The original use of this was to generate definitions of constants in
        homework assignments done in the Racket programming language.  So as
        an example of writing a test code for rational number data-type::
        
            ;; Constant Gen: r([0-9]+)/([0-9]+) (make-rational \1 \2)
            
            (check-expect (rational-add r7/9 r5/6) r29/18)
        
        Would become::
        
            ;; Constant Gen: r([0-9]+)/([0-9]+) (make-rational \1 \2)
            (define r29/18 (make-rational 29 18))
            (define r5/6 (make-rational 5 6))
            (define r7/9 (make-rational 7 9))
        
            (check-expect (rational-add r7/9 r5/6) r29/18)
        
        And no matter how many times you run the program on the source file,
        it will only generate the same output, or add/remove boilerplate
        according to how the source file changed.
        
        With this, one can keep the boilerplate in VCS and use ``txt2boil`` to
        update it whenever they need to.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The preferred way to install this is using pip::
        
            pip install txt2boil
        
        Although if you're not a regular pip user or are not used to using pip
        then the alternative is to just download the repository with git::
        
            git clone https://github.com/kcolford/txt2boil.git
            cd txt2boil
        
        Or you can download the tar package from the PyPi website by `clicking
        here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txt2boil>`_ and then clicking on
        the big green Download icon.  Alternatively you can use ``wget`` (or
        ``curl`` if you prefer)::
        
            wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/t/txt2boil/txt2boil-x.x.x.tar.gz
        
        Once you have the tar ball, unpack it and change to the directory
        containing it::
        
            tar xf txt2boil-x.x.x.tar.gz
            cd txt2boil-x.x.x
        
        Once you're in the source repository (regardless of how you got it)
        run the ``setup.py`` script::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        How To Use
        ----------
        
        In order to use ``txt2boil`` as in the example above, simply use::
        
            txt2boil -i rational.rkt
        
        The ``-i`` option specifies to update the file in place rather than
        outputting it on stdout.
        
        Supported Languages
        -------------------
        
        Language support all depends on what language the package's core
        library has functionality for.  The current languages that are
        supported are:
        
        - C
        - C++
        - Java
        - Python
        - Racket
        
        Internet Presence 
        -----------------
        
        There are two significant web resources for txt2boil.  The first is
        the source repository and the second is the PyPi page.  Regardless of
        which one you go to, this document ought to be the main page found
        there.
        
        The primary source repository can be found at `Git Hub
        <https://github.com/kcolford/txt2boil>`_ while the PyPi (Python
        Package Index) page can be found `here
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txt2boil/>`_.
        
        While the Git Hub repository only has source code, the PyPi page has
        downloads for binary distributions.  These binary distributions are
        provided by anyone generous enough to lend their computer to the task
        of compiling them and uploading them.  Anyone who has privileges to
        upload to PyPi need only run either the shell script ``upload.sh``
        **or** the batch script ``upload.bat``.
