"""The version module for this package.

Whenever this module is imported, it will always attempt to update its
version string by fetching a new one from the VCS.  If that fails then
it retains the one that's already saved to its cache file.  The cache
file is the current module's _version module (_version.py).

Currently, only git is a supported VCS.
