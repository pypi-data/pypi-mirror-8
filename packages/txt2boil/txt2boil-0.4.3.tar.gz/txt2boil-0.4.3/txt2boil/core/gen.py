        overload should make use of the coop.nonNoneCMI function
        decorator so that multiple different comments can be processes
        with one class.
        
        For example, if one were to write a Foo generator then it
        would look something like this:

        from txt2boil.core import *
        import txt2boil.cmi

        class Foo(Gen):

        Note the way that Foo was wrapped in a lambda before being
        passed to the cmi decorator.  If this was not done then it
        would cause a syntax error because Foo is not defined at this
        point.
