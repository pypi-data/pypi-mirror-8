Description: txt2boil
        ********
        
        This is a boilerplate generator that generates code based on the
        comments it finds in source code.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The preferred way to install this is using pip::
        
            pip install txt2boil
        
        Although if you're not a regular pip user or are not used to using pip
        then the alternative is to just download the repository with git and
        run the setup.py script::
        
            git clone https://github.com/kcolford/txt2boil.git
            cd txt2boil
            python setup.py install
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        The motivation is that ordinary boilerplate generators either require
        you to hack the build system you're using (to build the source code on
        the fly) or you statically generate the boiler plate (and are then
        unable to modify it or generate more without pulling together the
        script that first generated it).
