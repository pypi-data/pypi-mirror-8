Design Goals
------------

Django-secure does not make your site secure. It does not audit code, or do
intrusion detection, or really do anything particularly interesting or
complicated.

Django-secure is an automated low-hanging-fruit checklist. Django-secure helps
you remember the stupid simple things that improve your site's security,
reminds you to do those easy things, and makes them as easy as possible to do.
