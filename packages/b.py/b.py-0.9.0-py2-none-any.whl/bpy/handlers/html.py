HTML handler simply takes the file content as its output, and assume it's valid
HTML, therefore the handler doesn't edit or validate the content.

You can specify embed_images_, for example:

.. code:: python

  handlers = {
    'HTML': {
      'options': {
        'embed_images': True,
      },
    },
  }
"""

from bpy.handlers import base


class Handler(base.BaseHandler):
  """Handler for HTML

  >>> handler = Handler(None)
  >>> print(handler.generate_header({'title': 'foobar'}))
  <!-- !b
  title: foobar
  -->
  <BLANKLINE>
  """

  PREFIX_HEAD = '<!-- '
  PREFIX_END = '-->'
  HEADER_FMT = '%s: %s'

  def _generate(self, markup=None):
    """Return markup untouched

    This handler doesn't do anything to the markup.

    >>> handler = Handler(None)
    >>> print(handler._generate('<br/>'))
    <br/>
    """
    if markup is None:
      markup = self.markup

    return markup
