Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product is a replacement of the basic Plone Event content type.
        
        Is the main part of the `monet.calendar.star`__ suite, but you can use it freely as indipendent product.
        
        __ http://plone.org/products/monet.calendar.star
        
        It provides a lot of additional field, developed for the *City of Modena* public event management
        system.
        Apart new content data, and an image field, you can now choose:
        
        * `Cadence` - weekdays where the event really happen
        * `Except` - specific days where the event *is not* available
        * `Including` - specific days where the event *is* available (apart from other filters)
        * ...other

           Some of the new fields in the event editing form
        
        Also, the "*event type*" field is now a closed list of values (see below for customization). 
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        From ZMI you need to customize the *event_types* property inside the *monet_calendar_event_properties*
        property sheet.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Used as it is, all the recurring information are no more that data inside the content. Please see

        Warning
        -------

        Dependencies
        ============
        
        For "Except" days selection, `rt.calendarinandout`__ widget is needed

        Migrating from older release
        ============================
        
        If you have a Plone site where you used and old version of ``monet.calendar.event`` (older than 0.4)
