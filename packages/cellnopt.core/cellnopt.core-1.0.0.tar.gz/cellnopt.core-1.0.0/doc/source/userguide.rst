The different formats
#########################

There are quite a few formats out there and cellnopt.core provides some
converters.

The following image is not stricly speaking complete but give an idea of what
formats are used and how they are linked together. 

A relation A to B may mean (i) A can be exported to B or A can be an input to B
(or loaded). 


For instance CNOGraph can take as input a SIF instance or a filename that links
to a SIF file. Conversely it can export a SIF into a file. CNOGraph can be saved
into a json that can be then loaded (loadjson).

    c.add_reaction('SOP=reactions')
    c.add_reaction('SOP=CNOGraph')
    c.add_reaction('SOP=SIF')
    c.add_reaction('SIF=reactions')
    c.add_reaction('SIF=CNOGraph')
    c.add_reaction('Adjacency=SIF')
    c.add_reaction('Adjacency=CNOGraph')
    c.add_reaction('Graph=CNOGraph')
    c.add_reaction('DiGraph=CNOGraph')
    c.add_reaction('SIF=CNOGraph')
    c.add_reaction('SIF=SBML')

    c.add_reaction("NET=SIF")

    c._stimuli = ["CNOGraph"]
    c.plotdot()






.. _sif:

SIF
===

The SIF format is a cytoscape compatible format, which is just a space or tab separated
value format. The advantage is its simplicity. Here is an example::

   specy1 1 specy2
   specy1 1 specy3

with the disadvantage that this format does not include any layout information
and comments cannot be added. 

Each line in a SIF file represents an interaction between a source (left) and one or
more target nodes (right)::

    nodeA relationship nodeB
    nodeC relationship nodeA
    nodeD relationship nodeE nodeF nodeB

The SIF format used in CellNOpt is actually a subset of the official SIF
format:

 * Generally there is only one target
 * The relationship can be only the number 1 or -1 (for inhibitor)
 * Duplicated entries are not ignored but only the latest is taken into account
 * OR relations are implicit: a relation "A 1 C" and a relation "B 1 C" should be understood as A OR B gives C
 * special word "and" is used to code an AND relationship. An AND gate requires  3 relations::

       A 1 and1
       B 1 and1
       and1 1 C

Delimiters can be spaces or tabs (mixed).

With **cellnopt.core**, you can create a SIF instance from scratch and populate
it as follows::

    >>> s1 = SIF()
    >>> s1.add_reaction("A=C")
    >>> s1.add_reaction("B=C")

    >>> #or simply:
    >>> s2 = SIF()
    >>> s2.add_reaction("A+B=C")

Some operators are available::

    >>> s2 == s
    True

There is no plotting functions associated with the SIF class but you can easily
create a CNOGrapg instance and plot the model::

    c = CNOGraph(s)
    c.plotdot()

.. _midas:



MIDAS 
================

The MIDAS (Minimum Information for Data Analysis in Systems Biology) format is used 
in CellNOpt software. For more details, please see [DataRail1]_ and [DataRail2]_.

An example of a MIDAS file looks like::

    TR:mock:CellLine, TR:EGF, TR:TNFa, TR:PI3Ki, DA:Akt, DA:Hsp27, DV:Akt, DV:Hsp27
    1,                1,      0,       0,        0,      0,        0,      0
    1,                0,      1,       0,        0,      0,        0,      0
    1,                1,      0,       0,        10,     10,       0.82,   0.7
    1,                0,      1,       0,        10,     10,       0.91,   0.7




Format
--------

MIDAS files are CSV files (comma separated). The content is defined in the first
line of the file that constitutes the header (only 1 line). In the header,
colums can take two forms::

    XX:userword
    XX:userword:category

where XX is a 2-letter word prefix that describes the column content (see table
below for valid word),  **userword** is a word provided by the user that could
be the protein name. Category is a keyword that is optional except for the cell lines names. Category  
could be one of CellLine, Stimuli or Inhibitors. In practice Stimuli is never used.
Inhibitors could be used to alleviate ambiguity coming from the MIDAS format when defining inhibitors
(see below). Some MIDAS file encode other categories (e.g. cyto, NOLIG)  but there are ignored in 
CellNOptR and cellnopt.core.

MIDAS files include the concept of cues, signals, and responses (Gaudet et al.,
2005):

* cues are biological perturbations to a system (such as the addition of extracellular ligands)
* signals represent the activities of proteins or other biomolecules involved in transducing biological 
  information (activation of an intracellular kinase, for example), 
* responses also called readouts represent phenotypic changes such as
  proliferation, cell death or cytokine release. 

In MIDAS, cues can be stimuli or inhibitors. Signals and responses are
measurements made on species (the specy usage does not correspond to human or mouse but
protein/kinases,phenotype...)


============ ================  ======================
Code         Description        handled in CellNOptR
============ ================  ======================
ID           identifiers        ignored but stored
TR           treatment          yes
DA           Data aquistion     yes
DV           Data value         yes
other                           ignored but stored
============ ================  ======================


Example:

.. csv-table:: example
   :header: "TR:mock:CellLine", "TR:EGF", "TR:TNFa", "TR:PI3Ki", "DA:Akt", "DA:Hsp27", "DV:Akt", "DV:Hsp27"

   1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 , 0, 0
   1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 , 0, 0
   1, 1, 0, 0, 10, 10 , 1, 0.2
   1, 0, 1, 0, 10, 10 , 1, 0.5


Each value is separated by a comma and you could have space, tabs between
commas. So, the final format could be as follows::

    TR:mock:CellLine, TR:EGF, TR:TNFa, TR:PI3Ki, DA:Akt, DA:Hsp27, DV:Akt,DV:Hsp27
    1,1,0,0, 0,0,   0,0
    1,0,1,0, 0,0,   0,0
    1,1,0,0, 10,10, 0.82,0.7
    1,0,1,0, 10,10, 0.91,0.7

More details about the header

* The first row is the header describing the content of each colum. 
* commas separate all fields.
* Valid code (e.g., TR) must be followed by a column (e.g., TR: or  DA:).
* additional category can be added: TR:EGF:Stimuli
* Special fields such  as NOCYTO and NOINHIB are ignored.
* The number of DA and DV must be equal except if you use the special name **DA:ALL**
  (see later).
* Inhibitors are coded by adding the letter *i* after the name (e.g., TR:PI3Ki)
  If this lead to ambiguity (i.e., a specy ends with *i*) then use the Inhibitor
  or Stimuli category (e.g., TR:PI3Ki:Stimuli


The data above is made of rows that length is as long as the header. Fields may
may be empty, which is not the case here. If so, software should replace the
value by (e.g., NA in  R language) and cope with it.

Each row represents a given treatment at a given time. Times are coded with the
DA code. Values are coded within the **DV** columns. In the 2 first
rows the time is 0. The next two other rows are coded for the time 10. The
treatements (3 first colums) are found at the different time.

In MIDAS file, data should be ordered by time although some software may deal
with it.

Filename issue
----------------

From [DataRail1]_::

    MIDAS file has a unique identifier (UID) composed of the following fields:
    (i) a two-letter data/file-type code (e.g., PDfor Primary Data, MD for
    multiplex data), (ii) a three-letter creator code (typically initials),
    (iii) an identification number of arbitrary length that is unique across
    the entire system, and (iv) a free-text suffix that serves as a mnemonic
    to improve human readability. For example, the primary data discussed in
    the text might be tagged MD-LGA-11111-CytoInh17phFI-BLK


In practice, only a few files are coded that way. One reason is that the
UID tag is hardly used. Another inconsistency is that dashes are not used or
replaced by _. Besides, many files contain the word Data. Finally, the
name tag (e.g. LGA above) is not good practice because public file should give
the feeling they belong to everybody. 
However, one consistency is the extension being **.csv**.

Proposal for filename convention
--------------------------------

 #. do not use the DATA/Data word. Instead start all files with MD- and use the extension .csv
 #. separate the names that describe your data with dashes. 
 #. Underscore could be use internally to refine a name
 #. MD must be capitalised, other names can use any convention but we recomment
    polish convention (e.g., capitalize words)

::

    MD-Tag1-Tag2.csv

MD indicates that this is a MIDAS file so no need to set Data in the filename
anymore. Tag1 is a general description tag (containing _ possibly) and Tag2 is a
variant of Tag1. For instance, Tag1 could be Toy and Tag2 a name to
differentiate different Toy data sets.

Correct::

    MD-Toy.csv
    MD-Toy-variant1.csv
    MD-LiverDream.csv
    MD-LiverDREAM.csv




CNA Reactions
=================

CNA reactions is a CSV-like format. Lines looks like::

    mek=erk   1 mek = 1 erk   |   #  0 1 0   436  825  1    1  0.01

The first column contains the reactions (mek=erk). Following columns until the
"|" sign decompose the reactions using a space to separate each component of the reaction. 
After the "|" sign, there are 9 extra columns. 

You can read CNA reactions. You can then convert them into SIF and CNOGraph
before plotting the graph::

    from cellnopt.core import *
    a = Reactions(get_share_file('reactions'))
    s = SIF()
    for x in a.reacID: s.add_reaction(x)
    c = CNOGraph(s)
    c.plotdot()


.. note:: future version may allow to directly read the CNA file from the
   CNOGraph structure itself.

See :class:`cellnopt.core.reactions.Reactions` class for more details.

CNA Metabolites
====================


Metabolites format is a CSV format that looks like::

    abl         abl         NaN     0   188  380    1    1
    akap79      akap79      NaN     0   989  442    1    1


You can read this file using :class:`cellnopt.core.metabolites.Metabolites` class:

.. doctest::

    >>> from cellnopt.core import Metabolites, get_share_file
    >>> filename = get_share_file("metabolites")
    >>> m = Metabolites(filename)
    <BLANKLINE>
    Reading Species ...
    Found an empty line. Skipped
    Found 94 species
    No valid notes were found. Skipping.


SOP
====

There is a function that converts SOP data file into SIF format in
:class:`cellnopt.core.sop2sif.SOP2SIF`

Kinexus
==============

Kinexus data are in Excel format. There is no facility to read the Excel
documentation directly and different format may be used. However, we can export
the excel sheet into a CSV file that can be read by the
:class:`cellnopt.core.kinexus.Kinexus` class.

.. _cnograph:

The CNOGraph data structure and plotting
############################################


The quick start already mentionned this data structure. Here is another example on how to play with the :meth:`~cellnopt.core.cnograph.CNOGraph.plotdot` plotting function. It relies on graphviz that must be installed but is quite convenient. Here is an example::

    from cellnopt.core import *
    c = cnograph.CNOGraph(get_share_file("PKN-Test.sif"), get_share_file("MD-Test.csv"))
    import networkx as nx

    # show a PNG image using matplotlib
    c.plotdot() 

.. plot::
    :width: 50%

    from cellnopt.core import *
    c = cnograph.CNOGraph(get_share_file("PKN-Test.sif"), get_share_file("MD-Test.csv"))
    c.plotdot() 


The plotdot function creates a dot file that is then shown within matplotlib. 
The node and edge attributes are set to default values using the MIDAS file
provided (e.g., stimuli are green boxes).

Additional attributes can be set if there are valid graphviz keywords. For
instance, we can add a URL attribute that could be used when creating a SVG
file:: 


    c.node["tnfa"]["URL"] = "http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01375"

similarly, graphviz option for the graph such as the resoultion (dpi), background color (bgcolor) can be set::

    c.graph['graph'] = {"dpi":100,'splines':True, 'bgcolor':'red'} 
    nx.write_dot(c, "test.dot")
 

Play around with graphviz to add visible clusters::

    import networkx as nx
    G = nx.to_agraph(c)
    G.add_subgraph(["A", "B", "C", "D"], name="cluster_1", label="test", fillcolor="#11ff11", color="black", style="filled")
    G.write("test.dot")
