                    - bulk fix for issues 37, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46
                    - added cpe_list method
                    - added elasticsearch example code
v0.6.1, 29/06/2014 -- Added full support for python 3.X
                    - python now supports python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4
v0.5.1, 26/05/2014 -- Added basic API for class CPE
                    - interface similar to python-cpe for more
                      advanced usage of CPE, I strongly recommend you
                      to use python-cpe. Nice code, good doc.
v0.5.0, 17/05/2014 -- Rewrite of NmapProcess
                    - removed Threads to read stdout/stderr
                    - replaced by Process
                    - use of semaphore to not consume CPU while looping
                    - added NmapTask class
                    - added NmapProcess.current_task
                    - added NmapProcess.tasks list
                    - fixed bug in NmapProcess.state
                    - note NmapProcess.is_alive() is not recommended
v0.4.9, 14/05/2014 -- Fix for issue 28 and added code samples
v0.4.8, 05/05/2014 -- Changes in OS fingerprint data API
                    - NmapHost now holds its OS fingerprint data in NmapHost.os
                      (NmapOSFingerpring object)
                    - fingerprint is now a property which means you have to call
                      it without () NmapHost.os.fingerprint and should be called
                      directly from NmapHost.os
                    - NmapHost.os.fingerprints return an array of os
                      fingerprints (strings)
                    - NmapHost.os.fingerprint return a concatenated string of
                      all fingerprints
                    - Fingerprints data are now accessible via
                      NmapHost.os.osmatches which returns a list of NmapOSMatch
                      objects
                    - NmapOSMatch objects might contain a list of NmapOSClass
                      objects matching with it
                    - NmapOSClass objects might contain a list of CPE object
                      related to the os class (CPE class will be improved and
                      API enriched)
                    - TODO: finalize API doc and create all related unit tests
v0.4.7, 03/05/2014 -- minor fix for issue25
                    - fixed exception when optional service tag is not present
                      in <port> tag
                    - added support for <owner> if present in <port>:
                      accessible via NmapService.owner
v0.4.6, 06/04/2014 -- minor fix
                    - corrected missing incomplete parameter on parse_fromfile
                      and parse_fromstring
                    - added support to run scan in background with sudo support
                      added NmapProcess.sudo_run_background()
                    - fixed issue with run() blocking when an error triggered
                      during the scan
v0.4.5, 06/04/2014 -- minor fixes and botox injections
                    - Added "incomplete" argument in NmapReport.parse()
                      in order to enable parsing of incomplete or interrupted
                      nmap scans. Could be useful to use with a background
                      scan to parse incomplete data blocks from callback
                      function (thanks @Sibwara for the idea).
                    - Fixed bug when NmapReport.summary is empty
                    - added NmapReport.endtimestr
                    - remplaced ElementTree by cElementTree (performance)
v0.4.4, 04/04/2014 -- Bugs and features requests
                    - added support for tunnel attribute from <service> tag
                    - added support for servicefp (service fingerprint) in
                      attributes from <port><service> tag
                    - added support for reasons attributes from <port> tag
                    - added support for extraports/extrareasons tags
                    - corrected bug in serialization: missing extra data
                      (pull request from DougRoyal)
v0.4.3, 14/03/2014 -- Lots of bug corrections - Warning small changes in API:
                      - fix issue#14: better scripts parsing
                      - API change for NmapService.scripts_results:
                          NmapService.scripts_results is now a property
                          NmapService.scripts_results return an array of scripts results
                  
                      - fix issue#9 address field not correcly parsed:
                        MAC Address would erase an ipv4 address type.
                      - added new properties in hosts object API:
                          NmapHost.ipv4, NmapHost.ipv6, NmapHost.mac
                      - NmapHost.address property returns the IPv4 or IPv6 or MAC
                        in that preference order. Use specific calls for determinists
                        results
                      - fix API issue#10: os_ports_used
v0.4.2, 26/12/2013 -- Bug corrected: issue 8
                      There is no guarantee that "finished" or "runstats" will be
                      received by event parser of process.py.
                      Summary functions are now flagged as deprecated. To use data
                      from scan summary of numbers of hosts up, the user of the
                      lib will have to use NmapParser.parse() and the appropriate
                      accessors.
