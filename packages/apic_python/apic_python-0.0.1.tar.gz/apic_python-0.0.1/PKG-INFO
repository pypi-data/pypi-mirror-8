Description: configuration-python
        ====================
        
        All the codes are in object oriented style.
        They are functional codes and at the some time they are sample codes. Programmer can simply write their customized script by inheriting the class createMo in “createMo.py”.  
        
        
        #How to use:
        
        All the codes support three different input methods: wizard, yaml and cli.
        
        1. wizard: configure a mo by following a wizard. Usage: 
        <br>python createFilter.py wizard
        <br>To get the help info: python createFilter.py wizard –h
        
        2. yaml: configure a mo with a config file (yaml format). Usage:
        <br>python createFilter.py yaml createFilter.yaml
        <br>To get the help info: python createFilter.py yaml –h
        
        3. cli: configure a mo based on you python arguments.  It contains key arguments and optional arguments. Flags are used in order to call the optional arguments. Usage:
        <br>python createFilter.py cli 172.31.216.100 admin ins3965! tenantA filterA –e ip –i tcp 
        <br>To get the help info: python createFilter.py cli –h
        
        
        #What are those codes:
        
        createMo.py: the basic class/module. It also contains useful functions that help programmers for writing their customized scripts.
        
        The other scripts are functional scripts. Each of them does a small work. For example, createTenant.py only creates an “empty” tenant without any other setup.
        
        
        #How to delete a mo:
        
        Using -d flag. Example if you want to delete a filter, you can call createFilter.py with a -d flag. The delete method is supported in all three input methods. For example:
        
        <br>python createFilter -d yaml
        <br>python createFilter -d wizard
        <br>python createFilter -d cli 172.31.216.100 admin ins3965! tenantA filterA
