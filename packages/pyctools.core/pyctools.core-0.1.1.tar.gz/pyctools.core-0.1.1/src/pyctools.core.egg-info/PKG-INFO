Description: Pyctools
        ========
        
        A picture processing algorithm development kit.
        
        Pyctools is a collection of picture processing primitive components that you can easily interconnect to make complex algorithm simulations.
        It works with stills or video, and utilises popular libraries such as `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and `OpenCV <http://opencv.org/>`_.

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ version 2.7 or 3.x.
        * `Guild <https://github.com/sparkslabs/guild>`_ for communicating components.
        * `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ for its powerful multi-dimensional array object.
        * `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ for image file reading and writing. (The `pillow <http://python-pillow.github.io/>`_ fork of PIL is recommended.)
        * `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ to build fast extensions for Python.
        * `gexiv2 <https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gexiv2>`_ to handle metadata.
        * `OpenCV <http://opencv.org/>`_ python bindings (optional) for advanced image processing.
        * `FFmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>`_ (optional) to read and write video files.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Please see `the documentation <https://pythonhosted.org/pyctools.core/manual/installation.html>`_ for full details of how to install Pyctools and its requirements.
