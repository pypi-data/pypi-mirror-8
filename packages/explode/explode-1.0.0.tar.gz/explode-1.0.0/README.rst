Explode python data, yaml or json into flat files in directories.

It turns out that sometimes you need to drop some data onto a server.
Yaml and Json are both great for that, except that they suck to be
consumed in shell scripts. What shell scripts are great at are
directory structures and text files. SO - turn a python simple
data structure, or a yaml or json representation of one, into a
directory structure with text files.
