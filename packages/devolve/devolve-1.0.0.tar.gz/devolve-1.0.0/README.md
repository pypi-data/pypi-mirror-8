Devolve is a callback registry.  Callable objects can be registered against a
set of keys.  The registry can then be used to delegate a single call across
all of the registered callables and to gather all of the returned key/value
pairs into a single mapping.


## Features

* Prevents duplicate registration of the same key.
* Validation that a callable did not return any extra keys.
* Validation that a callable returned all of the keys it was registered for.
