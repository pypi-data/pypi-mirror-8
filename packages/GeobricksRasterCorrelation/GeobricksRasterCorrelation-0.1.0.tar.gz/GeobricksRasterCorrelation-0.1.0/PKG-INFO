Description: Geobricks Raster Correlation
        ====================
        
        The Geobricks Raster Correlation library provides an easy way correlate two raster of the same size, returning a json containing statistical outputs and frequencies information to be used directly with Highcharts JS library.
        
        Installation
        ============
        The library is distributed through PyPi and can be installed by typing the following command in the console:
        ```
        pip install GeobricksRasterCorrelation
        ```
        Examples
        ========
        
        ```python
        from geobricks_raster_correlation.core.raster_correlation_core import create_scatter
        
        raster_path1 = "../test_data/morocco/wheat_actual_biomprod_201010_doukkala.tif"
        raster_path2 = "../test_data/morocco/wheat_potential_biomprod_201010_doukkala.tif"
        # Number of bins to be applied to the scatter chart
        bins = 300
        corr = create_scatter(raster_path1, raster_path2, bins)
        print corr
        ```
        
        The returned json contains:
         
         * in corr['stats'] the statistics: slope, p_value, std_err, intercept, r_value
         * in corr['series'] there are the series. The series output can be used directly as an input with Highcharts.
