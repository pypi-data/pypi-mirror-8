Notes on random numbers
=======================

Uses dream.util.RNG as the random number generator.

You can set the seed using::

    dream.util.RNG = numpy.random.RandomState(seed)

This interface doesn't feel right, since one instance of DREAM may
influence another if they are running within one another.  Putting
the RNG on the dream class may be a better option.
