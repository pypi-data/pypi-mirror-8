Description: ====================
        rod.recipe.appengine
        ====================
        
        The rod.recipe.appengine is a zc.buildout recipe to build, test and deploy
        projects for the Google App Engine. It makes it easy to use eggs and resolve
        their dependencies automatically.
        
        To be honest, this is a recipe for scrambled eggs. It produces a zip file
        containing all configured external packages in a traditional folder hierarchy.

        =======
        
        Thanks to Attila Olah who provided a patch which fixes two issues where the
        recipe wasn't able to find the original pkg_resources.py file. He also enabled
        the recipe to be used together with distribute as a replacement for setuptools.
        
        Attila Olah also provided a patch for supporting regular expressions when using
        the exclude option.
        
        Thanks to Tom Lynn for submitting a patch which fixes an issue with symlink on
        platforms other than UNIX.
        
        Lots of thanks to Gael Pasgrimaud for submitting a patch that allows for
        zc.recipe.egg options such as extra-paths and entry-points.
        
        A brief documentation
        =====================
        
        This recipe takes a number of options:
        
        appengine-lib
            Path to an already installed appengine library
        
        appserver-script-name
            The name of the script in GAE to run the dev. server.
            The default is 'dev_appserver.py'. Because there have been
            intermediate versions of the GAE SDK using 'dev_appserver2.py',
            this script name is configurable.
        
        appserver-run-file
            The name of the run function in the "appserver-script-name" script.
            This name changed in GAE SDK > 1.7.5. Default is "_run_file".
            In previous GAE versions it was "run_file". This switch enables
            the use of this recipe for older GAE versions.
        
        eggs
            List of required eggs
        
        entry-points
            A list of entry-point identifiers. See zc.recipe.egg for a more detailed
            documentation.
        
        exclude
            A list of basenames and regular expressions to be excluded when setting up
            the application files, e.g. the whole 'tests' directory.
        
        ignore-packages
            List of packages that need to be ignored when setting up the applicaton files.
        
        extra-paths
            Extra paths to include in a generated script.
        
        initialization
            Specify some Python initialization code. This is very limited. In
            particular, be aware that leading whitespace is stripped from the code
            given.
        
        packages
            A list of packages to be included into the zip archive, which will be
            uploaded to the appspot.
        
        patch
            Specifies a patch file for patching the SDK source-tree. This option is
            not allowed if appengine-lib is specified.
        
        patch-options
            List of patch options separated by blanks. (Default=-p1)
        
        server-script
            The name of the script to run the development server.
        
        src
            The directory which contains the project source files.
        
        symlink-gae-runtime
            When this flag is True, a symlink to the "_python_runtime.py"
            script is created in the buildout 'bin' directory. 
            This script is needed for newer versions of the GAE SDK.
            You have to manually remove the symlink when you change this 
            flag from True to False.
            
        url
            The url for fetching the google appengine distribution
        
        use_setuptools_pkg_resources
            Flag whether the recipe shall copy setuptool's pkg_resources.py into the
            app directory rather than writing a dummy version. (Default=False)
        
        zip-name
            The name of the zip archive containing all external packages ready
            to deploy.
        
        zip-packages
            Flag whether external packages shall be zipped into a single zip file.
            (Default=True)
        
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        We will define a buildout template used by the recipe:
        
            >>> buildout_template = """
            ... [buildout]
            ... develop = %(dev)s
            ... parts = sample
            ...
            ... [sample]
            ... recipe = rod.recipe.appengine
            ... eggs = foo.bar
            ... packages =
            ...     bazpkg
            ...     tinypkg
            ... server-script = dev_appserver
            ... zip-packages = False
            ... exclude = .*foo/bar/test.*$
            ... url = http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/google_appengine_1.5.0.zip
            ... """
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout:
        
            >>> import os.path
            >>> import rod.recipe.appengine.tests as tests
            >>> egg_src = os.path.join(os.path.split(tests.__file__)[0], 'foo.bar')
            >>> baz_pkg = os.path.join(os.path.split(tests.__file__)[0], 'bazpkg')
            >>> tiny_pkg = os.path.join(os.path.split(tests.__file__)[0], 'tinypkg')
            >>> write('buildout.cfg', buildout_template %
            ...       {'dev': egg_src+' '+baz_pkg+' '+tiny_pkg})
        
        Running the buildout gives us:
        
            >>> print system(buildout)
            Develop: '.../tests/foo.bar'
            Develop: '.../tests/bazpkg'
            Develop: '.../tests/tinypkg'
            Installing sample.
            rod.recipe.appengine: downloading Google App Engine distribution...
            Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/dev_appserver'.
            Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/appcfg'.
        
        This will generate some scripts:
        
            >>> ls('bin')
            -  appcfg
            -  buildout
            -  dev_appserver
        
        And now we try to run the appserver script:
        
            >>> print system(os.path.join('bin', 'dev_appserver'), '-h')
            Runs a development application server for an application.
            ...
        
        There should be a configuration script in bin as well:
        
            >>> print system(os.path.join('bin', 'appcfg'))
            Usage: appcfg [options] <action>
            ...
        
        Let's see if the 'tests' directory has been excluded:
        
            >>> l = os.listdir(os.sep.join(['parts', 'sample', 'foo', 'bar']))
            >>> assert 'tests' not in l
        
        There should be a baz package within our application directory:
        
            >>> assert 'baz' in os.listdir(os.sep.join(['parts', 'sample']))
        
        Let's define another buildout template used by the recipe:
        
            >>> buildout_template = """
            ... [buildout]
            ... develop = %(dev)s

            ... [second_sample]
            ... recipe = rod.recipe.appengine
            ... eggs = foo.bar
            ... use_setuptools_pkg_resources = True
            ... packages =
            ...     bazpkg
            ...     tinypkg
            ... patch = %(patch)s
            ... patch-options = -p1
            ... zip-packages = False
            ... exclude = tests
            ... url = http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/google_appengine_1.5.0.zip
            ... """
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout:
        
            >>> import os.path
            >>> import rod.recipe.appengine.tests as tests
            >>> egg_src = os.path.join(os.path.split(tests.__file__)[0], 'foo.bar')
            >>> baz_pkg = os.path.join(os.path.split(tests.__file__)[0], 'bazpkg')
            >>> tiny_pkg = os.path.join(os.path.split(tests.__file__)[0], 'tinypkg')
            >>> patch = os.path.join(os.path.split(tests.__file__)[0], 'patch.diff')
            >>> write('buildout.cfg', buildout_template %
            ...       {'dev': egg_src+' '+baz_pkg+' '+tiny_pkg, 'patch': patch})
        
        Running the buildout gives us:
        
            >>> output = system(buildout)
            >>> if output.endswith(
            ...     "patching file lib/patched/patched.txt\n"): True
            ... else: print output
            True
        
        And now we try to run the appserver script:
        
            >>> print system(os.path.join('bin', 'second_sample'), '-h')
            Runs a development application server for an application.
            ...
        
        Let's have a look if all dependent packages are copied into our application
        directory:
        
            >>> os.path.isfile(os.path.join('parts', 'second_sample', 'tinymodule.py'))
            True
            >>> os.path.isdir(os.path.join('parts', 'second_sample', 'baz'))
            True
        
        Setuptool's original pkg_resources.py file should be copied into our app
        directory:
        
            >>> pkg_resources = os.path.join(
            ...     'parts', 'second_sample', 'pkg_resources.py')
            >>> os.path.isfile(pkg_resources)
            True
            >>> pkg_resources_file = open(pkg_resources, "r")
            >>> pkg_resources_file.read().startswith('def _dummy_func')
            False
            >>> pkg_resources_file.close()
        
        We've configured the recipe to patch the SDK's source tree:
        
            >>> gae_sdk_root = os.path.join('parts', 'google_appengine')
            >>> patched_dir = os.listdir(os.path.join(gae_sdk_root, 'lib'))
            >>> patched_file = open(
            ...     os.path.join(gae_sdk_root, 'google', 'appengine', 'tools',
            ...                  'dev_appserver.py')).read()[:1300]
            >>> 'patched' in patched_dir
            True
            >>> '# This file is patched by the patch command.' in patched_file
            True
        
        You can also add some extra script:
        
            >>> buildout_template = """
            ... [buildout]

        Changes
        =======
        
        2.0.6 2014-12-31
        ----------------
        
            - use_setuptools_pkg_resources support for pkg_resources as a package
              and the setuptools zip is unpacked during installation [jjmurre] 
        
        
        2.0.5 2014-12-30
        ----------------
        
            - pkg_resources has changed from a module to a package which broke
              the 'use_setuptools_pkg_resources' option. Now the package is copied if
              it is a package. [jjmurre]
        
        2.0.4 2014-09-04
        ----------------
        
            - Added 'ignore-packages' configuration, to exclude problematic packages [jjmurre]
              
        2.0.3 2013-06-17
        ----------------
            
            - Fix for issue 18/20/21: appcfg should not use the 'appserver-run-file' config. variable.
            
        2.0.2 2013-06-18
        ----------------
        
            - Added 'appserver-script-name' configuration, to accomodate alternative
              appserver scripts names (some versions in the 1.7.x range used
              dev_appserver2.py). [jjmurre]
        
            - Added 'appserver-run-file' configurations, because Google changed this
              name somewhere in the 1.7.x version range. [jjmurre]
        
            - Added 'symlink-gae-runtime'. Throught this switch a symlink to
              the GAE runtime script '_python_runtime.py' can be made in de 
              buildout bin directory. This symlink is needed, because the
              developments server had been thouroughly rewritten by Google. [jjmurre]
        
        2.0.1 2013-02-21
        ----------------
        
          - Made dev_appserver configurable (dev_appserver/dev_appserver2) [attilaolah]
        
        2.0.0 2011-07-01
        ----------------
        
          - Adds support for zc.recipe.eggs options such as entry-points and
            extra-paths.
        
        
        1.7.0 2011-05-16
        ----------------
        
          - Adds support for regular expression excludes.
        
          - Minor refactoring and clean-up.
        
        
        1.6.2 2010-04-18
        ----------------
        
          - Fixes an issue where symlink fails on platforms other than UNIX.
        
        
        1.6.1 2010-04-03
        ----------------

        1.6.0 2010-04-03
        ----------------
        
          - New option to specify a patch file for modifying the Google App Engine
            SDK source tree.
        
        
        1.5.1 2010-03-27
        ----------------
        
          - Fixes an issue where setuptools wasn't found.
        
          - Distribute can be used as a replacement for setuptools.
        
          - Added credits for Attila Olah.
        
        
        1.5.0 2010-03-27
        ----------------
        
          - Adds option to copy setuptool's original pkg_resources.py file into app
            directory rather than writing a dummy stub.
        
        
        1.4.1 2010-01-18
        ----------------
        
          - Fixes an issue where egg contents which are just single modules aren't
