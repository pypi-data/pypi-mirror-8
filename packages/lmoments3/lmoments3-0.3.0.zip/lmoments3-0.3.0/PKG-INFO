Description: # lmoments3
        
        Python 3.x library to estimate linear moments for statistical distribution
        functions
        
        Requires the packages `numpy` and `scipy`.
        
        For the Python 2.x compatible package see `lmoments` on the Python Package 
        Index.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Documentation is available on [Read the Docs](http://open-hydrology.readthedocs.org/projects/lmoments3/).
        Souce code etc. on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenHydrology/lmoments3).
        
        ## Origin
        
        This package contains a Python 3.x implementation of the lmoments.f library created by
        J. R. M. HOSKING. ([copy of original code](https://github.com/pierregm/scikits.hydroclimpy/blob/master/scikits/hydroclimpy/stats/lmoments.f))
