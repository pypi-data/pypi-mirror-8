        **python-xbrl** is a library for parsing
        `xbrl <http://www.xbrl.org/Specification/XBRL-2.1/REC-2003-12-31/XBRL-2.1-REC-2003-12-31+corrected-errata-2013-02-20.html>`__
        documents providing output as both a basic model object and serialized
        objects thur
        `marshmallow <http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ for
        rendering into standards formats like JSON or HTTP API
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install python-xbrl is with pip
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install python-xbrl
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        If you really want to become familiar with this library, read the
        docstrings in the code.
        
        Initialization
        --------------
        
        To start using the library, first import the ``XBRLParser``
        
        ::
        
            from xbrl import XBRLParser
        
        Simple Parsing Workflow
        -----------------------
        
        First parse the incoming XRBL file into a new ``XBRL`` basic object
        
        ::
        
            xbrl_parser = XBRLParser()
            xbrl = XBRLParser.parse(file("sam-20131228.xml"))
        
        Then you can parse the document using different parsers
        
        ::
        
            gaap_obj = XBRLParser.parseGAAP(xbrl, doc_date="20131228", doc_type="10-K", context="current")
        
        Now we have a ``GAAP`` model object that has the GAAP parsed elements
        from the document.
        
        This model object supports the several different features including:
        
        -  ``doc_type`` currently only 10-K and 10-Q is supported
        -  ``context`` current, year, and instant contexts are supported. If available you can also get previous quarter information by number of days from doc date. Example: 90, 180, etc.
        
        You can serialize the GAAP model object into a serialized object
        acceptable for rending into a standard format such as JSON or HTTP API.
        
        ::
        
            serialized = GAAPSerializer(gaap_obj)
        
        You can also just view the data in the serialized object
        
        ::
        
            print serialized.data
        
        You can apply various parsers to the base ``XBRLParser`` object to get
        different data than just GAAP data from the document. In addition as
        expected you can also create different serialized objects on the
        resulting parsed data object.
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To run the unit tests, you need pytest
        
        ::
        
            pip install pytest
        
        Once you have that, ``cd`` into the root directory of this repo and
        
        ::
        
            py.test --tb=line -vs
