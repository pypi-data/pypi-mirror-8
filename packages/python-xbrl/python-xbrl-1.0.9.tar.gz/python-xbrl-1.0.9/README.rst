**python-xbrl** is a library for parsing
`xbrl <http://www.xbrl.org/Specification/XBRL-2.1/REC-2003-12-31/XBRL-2.1-REC-2003-12-31+corrected-errata-2013-02-20.html>`__
documents providing output as both a basic model object and serialized
objects thur
`marshmallow <http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ for
rendering into standards formats like JSON or HTTP API

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install python-xbrl is with pip

::

    sudo pip install python-xbrl

Usage
-----

If you really want to become familiar with this library, read the
docstrings in the code.

Requirements
------------

- Python >= 2.6 or >= 3.3

python-xbrl relies on `beautifulsoup4 <http://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ 
which sits on top of the python XML parser `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`__. It also requires 
`marshmallow <http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ for serializing objects. 
For more details see `requirements.txt <https://github.com/greedo/python-xbrl/blob/master/requirements.txt>`__



Initialization
--------------

To start using the library, first import the ``XBRLParser``

::

    from xbrl import XBRLParser

Simple Parsing Workflow
-----------------------

First parse the incoming XRBL file into a new ``XBRL`` basic object

::

    xbrl_parser = XBRLParser()
    xbrl = XBRLParser.parse(file("sam-20131228.xml"))

Then you can parse the document using different parsers

::

    gaap_obj = XBRLParser.parseGAAP(xbrl, doc_date="20131228", doc_type="10-K", context="current", ignore_errors=0)

Now we have a ``GAAP`` model object that has the GAAP parsed elements
from the document.

This model object supports the several different features including:

-  ``doc_type`` currently only 10-K and 10-Q is supported
-  ``context`` current, year, and instant contexts are supported. If available you can also get previous quarter information by number of days from doc date. Example: 90, 180, etc.
-  Error handling. ``0`` raise exception for all parsing errors and halt parsing, ``1`` Supress all parsing errors and continue parsing, ``2`` Log all parsing errors and continue parsing 

You can serialize the GAAP model object into a serialized object
acceptable for rending into a standard format such as JSON or HTTP API.

::

    serialized = GAAPSerializer(gaap_obj)

You can also just view the data in the serialized object

::

    print serialized.data

You can apply various parsers to the base ``XBRLParser`` object to get
different data than just GAAP data from the document. In addition as
expected you can also create different serialized objects on the
resulting parsed data object.

Testing
-------

To run the unit tests, you need pytest

::

    pip install pytest

Once you have that, ``cd`` into the root directory of this repo and

::

    py.test --tb=line -vs
