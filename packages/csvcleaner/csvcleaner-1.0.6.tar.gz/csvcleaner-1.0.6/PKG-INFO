Description: CSV Cleaner
        ===========
        
        CSV Cleaner is an Apache 2.0 licensed Python library that removes rows
        containing blacklisted words from a CSV file.
        
        Instructions
        ------------
        
        ```python
        >>> import csvcleaner
        >>> f = csvcleaner.CSVCleaner()
        >>> f.run('/path/to/file.csv')
        ```
        
        When ``run`` is called, CSV Cleaner will loop through each row within the CSV file and search for blacklisted words.
        
        When a row is rejected because it contains a blacklisted word, it's moved to a ``[name]-rejected.csv`` file. Accepted rows are moved to a ``[name]-accepted.csv`` file. Both files are saved in the same directory as the original CSV file.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install CSV Cleaner, simply run:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install csvcleaner
        ```
        
        Parmateres
        ----------
        
        ``CSVCleaner`` accepts several parameters:
        
        ```python
        >>> import csvcleaner
        >>> f = csvcleaner(blacklist=[], replace_chars=[], configure=True, lowercase=True, strict=False)
        ```
        
        #### blacklist
        
        A ``list`` of characters or words that are used to determine if a row is rejected.
        
        Default: ``[]`` (unless ``configure`` is ``True``)
        
        #### replace_chars
        
        A ``list`` of words or characters that are replaced by a space in order to make word detection more accurate and effective.
        
        Default: ``[]`` (unless ``configure`` is ``True``)
        
        #### configure
        
        When ``True``, CSV Cleaner will use recommended lists for ``blacklist`` and ``replace_chars``. These recommended lists will only be used if ``blacklist`` and ``replace_chars`` are ommitted during class instantiation or contain an empty list. Set to ``False`` if you intend to supply custom lists for ``blacklist`` and ``replace_chars``.
        
        Default: ``True``.
        
        #### lowercase
        
        When ``True``, all characters and strings will be converted to lowercase for more accurate word detection. When a row is inserted into ``[name]-accepted.csv`` or ``[name]-rejected.csv``, its original case remains. Set to ``False`` if case matching is important.
        
        Default: ``True``.
        
        #### strict
        
        When ``True``, rows that *may* contain (e.g., fuzzy matches) blacklisted words or characters are rejected.
        
        Default: ``False``.
        
        Blacklist
        ---------
        
        CSV Cleaner includes a blacklist that's used when ``configure`` is ``True`` and
        ``blacklist`` is left empty. This blacklist is maintained by [Shutterstock](https://github.com/shutterstock/)
