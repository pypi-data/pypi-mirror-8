Description: Build your own OAR cluster with docker
        --------------------------------------
        
        oar-docker is a set of docker images especially configured for deploying
        your own OAR cluster. The main idea is to have a mini development cluster with
        a frontend, a server and some nodes that launch in just a few seconds on a
        simple laptop.
        
        
        Why use oar-docker ?
        --------------------
        
        Various case scenarios may affect you:
         - Quickly test OAR on a cluster
         - Gain time: a ten-node cluster (or more) is launched in just a
           few seconds and is cleaned in less than a second.
         - Save resources: docker allows the user to pool the node between
           various systems, resource utilization is thus considerably reduced.
         - Synced volume : allowing you to continue working on your host machine, but
           use the resources in the guest machine to compile or run your project.

        Security
        --------
        
        oar-docker is a development project and a testing one. It is in no way secure.
        Besides, the private ssh key used is also insecured since it is public (you can find it in the sources).
