Description: Build your own OAR cluster with docker
        --------------------------------------
        
        oar-docker is a set of docker images especially configured for deploying
        your own OAR cluster. The main idea is to have a mini development cluster with
        a frontend, a server and some nodes that launch in just a few seconds on a
        simple laptop.
        
        
        Why use oar-docker ?
        --------------------
        
        Various case scenarios may affect you:
         - Quickly test OAR on a cluster
         - Gain time: a ten-node cluster (or more) is launched in just a
           few seconds and is cleaned in less than a second.
         - Save resources: docker allows the user to pool the node between
           various systems, resource utilization is thus considerably reduced.
         - Synced volume : allowing you to continue working on your host machine, but
           use the resources in the guest machine to compile or run your project.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install, upgrade, uninstall oar-docker with these commands::
        
          $ pip install oar-docker
          $ pip install --upgrade oar-docker
          $ pip uninstall oar-docker
        
        Or from git (last development version)::
        
          $ pip install git+https://github.com/oar-team/oar-docker.git
        
        Or if you already pulled the sources::
        
          $ pip install path/to/sources
        
        Or if you don't have pip::
        
          $ easy_install oar-docker

              init        Initialize a new environment.
              install     Install and configure OAR from src
              logs        Fetch the logs of all containers.
              ssh         Connect to machine via SSH.

              start       Start the cluster
              status      Output status of the cluster
              stop        Stop the running cluster
        
        
        Security
        --------
        
        oar-docker is a development project and a testing one. It is in no way secure.
        Besides, the private ssh key used is also insecured since it is public (you can
        find it in the sources).
