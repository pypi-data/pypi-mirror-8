Release history and notes
=====================================
0.2
-------------------------------------
2014-10-25

Note, that this release contains minor backwards incompatible changes.

- Minor (backwards incompatible) changes in the form handler plugin API. 
  From now on both ``custom_actions`` and ``get_custom_actions`` methods
  accept ``form_entry`` (obligatory) and ``request`` (optional) arguments. If
  you have written your own or have changed existing form handler plugins
  with use of one of the above mentioned methods, append those arguments to
  the method declarations when upgrading to this version. If you haven't
  written your own form or changed existing form handler plugins, you may
  just upgrade to this version.
- Added data export features to the ``db_store`` plugin.
- Minor fixes in ``db_store`` plugin.
- Added missing documentation for the ``feincms_integration`` app.
- Updated translations for Dutch and Russian.

0.1.6
-------------------------------------
2014-10-25

- Minor improvements in the theming API. From now on the
  ``view_embed_form_entry_ajax_template`` template would be used
  when integrating the form rendering from other products (for example,
  a CMS page, which has a widget which references the form object. If
  that property is left empty, the ``view_form_entry_ajax_template``
  is used. For a success page the ``embed_form_entry_submitted_ajax_template``
  template would be used.
- Functional improvements of the FeinCMS integration (the widget). If you
  have used the FeinCMS widget of earlier versions, you likely want to update 
  to this one. From now on you can select a custom form title and the button
  text, as well as provide custom success page title and the success  message;
  additionally, it has been made possible to hide the form- or success-page-
  titles.
