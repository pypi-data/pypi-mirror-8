0.4.1 - 2014-09-24
------------------

- Fix issue #39 reported by @buttscicles

  This bug did not properly parse the Set-Cookie header with multiple cookies
  when replaying a recorded response.

0.4.0 - 2014-07-29
------------------

- Allow the user to pass placeholders to ``Betamax#use_cassette``.

- Include Betamax's version number in cassettes

0.3.2 - 2014-06-05
------------------

- Fix request and response bodies courtesy of @dgouldin

0.3.1 - 2014-05-28
------------------

- Fix GitHub Issue #35 - Placeholders were not being properly applied to
  request bodies. This release fixes that so placeholders are now behave as
  expected with recorded request bodies.

0.3.0 - 2014-05-23
------------------

- Add ``Betamax#start`` and ``Betamax#stop`` to allow users to start recording
  and stop without using a context-manager.

- Add ``digest-auth`` matcher to help users match the right request when using
  requests' ``HTTPDigestAuth``.

- Reorganize and refactor the cassettes, matchers, and serializers modules.

- Refactor some portions of code a bit.

- ``Cassette.cassette_name`` no longer is the relative path to the file in
  which the cassette is saved. To access that information use
  ``Cassette.cassette_path``. The ``cassette_name`` attribute is now the name
  that you pass to ``Betamax#use_cassette``.

0.2.0 - 2014-04-12
------------------

- Fix bug where new interactions recorded under ``new_episodes`` or ``all``
  were not actually saved to disk.

- Match URIs in a far more intelligent way.

- Use the Session's original adapters when making new requests

  In the event the Session has a custom adapter mounted, e.g., the SSLAdapter
  in requests-toolbelt, then we should probably use that.

- Add ``on_init`` hook to ``BaseMatcher`` so matcher authors can customize
  initialization

- Add support for custom Serialization formats. See the docs for more info.

- Add support for preserving exact body bytes.

- Deprecate ``serialize`` keyword to ``Betamax#use_cassette`` in preference
  for ``serialize_with`` (to be more similar to VCR).

0.1.6 - 2013-12-07
------------------

- Fix how global settings and per-invocation options are persisted and
  honored. (#10)

- Support ``match_requests_on`` as a parameter sent to
  ``Betamax#use_cassette``. (No issue)

0.1.5 - 2013-09-27
------------------

- Make sure what we pass to ``base64.b64decode`` is a bytes object

0.1.4 - 2013-09-27
------------------

- Do not try to sanitize something that may not exist.

0.1.3 - 2013-09-27
------------------

- Fix issue when response has a Content-Encoding of gzip and we need to
  preserve the original bytes of the message.

0.1.2 - 2013-09-21
------------------

- Fix issues with how requests parses cookies out of responses

- Fix unicode issues with ``Response#text`` (trying to use ``Response#json``
  raises exception because it cannot use string decoding on a unicode string)

0.1.1 - 2013-09-19
------------------

- Fix issue where there is a unicode character not in ``range(128)``

0.1.0 - 2013-09-17
------------------

- Initial Release

- Support for VCR generated cassettes (JSON only)

- Support for ``re_record_interval``

- Support for the ``once``, ``all``, ``new_episodes``, ``all`` cassette modes

- Support for filtering sensitive data

- Support for the following methods of request matching:

  - Method

  - URI

  - Host

  - Path

  - Query String

  - Body

  - Headers
