Yeah Memory Issues!!


Memory Issues happens to the best of us.  `memory_utils` will give you some simple tools to help you quickly issolate
The cuplrit.  And ideally warn you before you run into issues.


From my experience there is no silver-bullet in dealing with memory issues.  You just have roll up your sleeve and get
dirty with print statements.  In our teams recent fight with a memory issue, we created a utility that we found useful
and we wanted to share



Install
-------

.. code:: bash

    pip install memory_utils
