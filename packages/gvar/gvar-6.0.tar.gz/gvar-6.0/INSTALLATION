To install:

0. Don't install gvar if you have installed lsqfit. gvar is a subset of 
   the lsqfit distribution.

1. If not already installed, download and install the following packages:
		
	a. The numpy python library - provides fast floating-point array 
		operations in python. Versions earlier than 1.6 may not work.
		(http://numpy.scipy.org/)

	b. The Cython python package - provides a variant of python that 
		compiles into C code that can itself be compiled and is faster (but
        less flexible) than ordinary python. Versions earlier than 0.17
		may not work. 
		(http://www.cython.org/)
				
	The gvar code works for Python 2.6 and 2.7, and Python 3.2-3.4. It
	does not work for Python versions 2.5.X or earlier. It has not been tested
	for Python 3.0 and 3.1, but likely works at least with the latter. Some
	of the tests don't work with Python 2.6.

2. Use 'make install'. This will build the gvar package, and 
	then copy it into a standard directory in the user's space that
	Python knows about. A list of the installed files is stored in file
	files-gvar.python (in case, for example, you want to uninstall them).
	
	N.B. Rather than using make and the makefile, one can instead use 
	standard distutils commands: eg, 'python setup.py install --user'
	
	N.B. If you have previously installed older versions of gvar,
	consider removing the earlier modules to make sure that the new ones are 
	used by Python. This will not be a problem if the new modules overwrite
	the older ones, but could cause trouble if the new modules are written 
	to a different place. Find out where the older modules are stored by
	using 'pydoc gvar' before installing the new software
	(pydoc lists the location of the module under "FILE").
	
	N.B. To install gvar for an alternative version of python, say python3 
	for example, use 'make PYTHON=python3 install'. Python's standard 
	directories are structured in such a way that it is necessary to do 
	a separate installation for each python version that will be used for 
	gvar.
		
	
3. (Optional) Run 'make tests' to test your installation of gvar if you
	are using Python 2.7 or later (they don't work as well with Python 2.6). 
	The tests have been successful if the output ends with "OK". 
	Some tests involve random numbers and so may occasionally --- less than 
	1 in 100 runs --- fail due to rare multi-sigma fluctuations; rerun the 
	tests if they do fail. Contact g.p.lepage@cornell.edu if there are 
	persistent, frequent failures.
	
	N.B. The tests can also be run directly using Python's unittest module:
	"python -m unittest discover".
		
4. (Optional) Use 'make clean' to erase work files/directories.


To uninstall:

1. 'make uninstall' (probably) uninstalls most of what was installed. It 
	relies upon files with names like "files-lsqfit.python" that were 
	created during installation.
