class Integrator(object):
    """ Integrate ``dy/dx = deriv(x,y)``.

    An :class:`Integrator` object ``odeint`` integrates ``dy/dx = f(x,y)``
    to obtain ``y(x1)`` from ``y0 = y(x0)``. ``y`` and ``f(x,y)`` can
    be scalars or :mod:`numpy` arrays. Typical usage is illustrated 
    by the following code for integrating ``dy/dx = y``::

        from gvar.ode import Integrator

        def f(x, y):
            return y

        odeint = Integrator(deriv=f,  tol=1e-8)
        y0 = 1.
        y1 = odeint(y0, interval=(0, 1.))
        y2 = odeint(y1, interval=(1., 2.))
        ...

    Here the first call to ``odeint`` integrates the differential equation
    from ``x=0`` to ``x=1`` starting with ``y=y0`` at ``x=0``; the result
    is ``y1=exp(1)``, of course. Similarly the second call to ``odeint``
    continues the integration from ``x=1`` to ``x=2``, giving ``y2=exp(2)``.

    If the ``interval`` is a list with more than two entries,
    then ``odeint(y0, interval=[x0, x1, x2 ...])`` in the example above
    returns an array of solutions for points ``x1, x2 ...``. So the example
    above could have been written equivalently as ::

        ...

        odeint = Integrator(deriv=f,  tol=1e-8)
        y0 = 1.
        y1, y2 ... = odeint(y0, interval=[0, 1., 2. ...])


    An alternative interface creates a new function which is the 
    solution of the differential equation for specific initial conditions.
    The code above could be rewritten::

        x0 = 0.         # initial conditions
        y0 = 1.
        y = Integrator(deriv=f, tol=1e-8).solution(x0, y0)
        y1 = y(1)
        y2 = y(2)
        ...

    Here method :meth:`Integrator.solution` returns a function ``y(x)`` 
    where: a) ``y(x0) = y0``; and b) ``y(x)`` uses the integator to 
    integrate the differential equation to point ``x`` starting 
    from  the last point at which ``y`` was evaluated 
    (or from ``x0`` for the first call to ``y(x)``). The function can
    also be called with an array of ``x`` values, in which case an 
    array containing the corresponding ``y`` values is returned.

    The integrator uses an adaptive Runge-Kutta algorithm that adjusts
    the integrator's step size to obtain relative accuracy ``tol`` in the solution.
    An initial step size can be set in the :class:`Integrator` by specifying
    parameter ``h``. A minimum step size ``hmin`` can also be specified;
    the :class:`Integrator` raises an exception if the step size becomes
    smaller than ``hmin``. The :class:`Integrator` keeps track of the
    number of good steps, where ``h`` is increased, and the number of
    bad steps, where ``h`` is decreased and the step is repeated:
    ``odeint.ngood`` and ``odeint.nbad``, respectively.

    A custom criterion for step-size changes can be implemented by 
    specifying a function for parameter delta. This is a function
    ``delta(yerr, y, delta_y)`` --- of the estimated error ``yerr``
    after a given step, the proposed value for ``y``, and the 
    proposed change ``delta_y`` in ``y`` --- that returns a number 
    to compare with tolerance ``tol``. The step size is 
    decreased and the step repeated if ``delta(yerr, y, delta_y) > tol``;
    otherwise the step is accepted and the step size increased. 
    The default definition of ``delta`` is roughly equivalent to::

        import numpy as np
        import gvar as gv
        
        def delta(yerr, y, delta_y):
            return np.max(
                np.fabs(yerr) / (np.fabs(y) + np.fabs(delta_y) + gv.ode.TINY)
                )
    
    A custom definition can be used to allow an ``Integrator`` to 
    work with data types other than floats or :mod:`numpy` arrays of floats. 
    All that is required of the data type is that it support 
    ordinary arithmetic. Therefore, for example, defining 
    ``delta(yerr, y, delta_y)`` with ``np.abs()`` instead of ``np.fabs()``
    allows ``y`` to be complex valued. (Actually the default ``delta`` 
    allows this as well.)

    An analyzer ``analyzer(x,y)`` can be specified using parameter
    ``analyzer``. This function is called after every full step of
    the integration, with the current values of ``x`` and ``y``. 
    Objects of type :class:`gvar.ode.Solution` are examples of 
    (simple) analyzers.

    :param deriv: Function of ``x`` and ``y`` that returns ``dy/dx``. 
        The return value should have the same shape as ``y`` if arrays
        are used.
    :param tol: Relative accuracy in ``y`` relative to ``|y| + h|dy/dx|``
        for each step in the integration. Any integration step that achieves
        less precision is repeated with a smaller step size. The step size
        is increased if precision is higher than needed. Default is 1e-5.
    :type tol: float
    :param h: Absolute value of initial step size. The default value equals the
        entire width of the integration interval.
    :type h: float or None
    :param hmin: Smallest step size allowed. An exception is raised
        if a smaller step size is needed. This is mostly useful for 
        preventing infinite loops caused by programming errors. The 
        default value is zero (which does *not* prevent infinite loops).
    :type hmin: float or None
    :param delta: Function ``delta(yerr, y, delta_y)`` that returns 
        a number to be compared  with ``tol`` at each integration step: 
        if it is larger than ``tol``, the step is repeated with a smaller 
        step size; if it is smaller the step is accepted and a larger 
        step size used for the subsequent step. Here ``yerr`` is an 
        estimate of the error in ``y`` on the last step; ``y`` is the 
        proposed value; and ``delta_y`` is the change in ``y`` over 
        the last step.
    :param analyzer: Function of ``x`` and ``y`` that is called after each
        step of the integration. This can be used to analyze intermediate
        results.
