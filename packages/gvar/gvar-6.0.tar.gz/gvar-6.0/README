gvar
------
This package provides tools for creating and manipulating 
Gaussian random variables from correlated multi-dimensional
Gaussian distributions. The Gaussian variables are represented
by objects of type :class:`gvar.GVar` which can be combined 
with each other and with ordinary numbers in arbitrary
arithmetic expressions, including standard functions such
``sin`` and ``exp``, to create new :class:`gvar.GVar`\s whose
correlations with the original variables are tracked implicitly
(and handled correctly).

This package relies on ``numpy`` for efficient array arithmetic, 
and on Cython to compile efficient core routines and interface code.

Information on how to install the components is in the INSTALLATION file. 

To test the libraries try 'make tests'. (Some tests involve random
numbers and so may occasionally --- less than 1 in 100 runs --- fail due to
rare multi-sigma fluctuations; rerun the tests if they do fail.)
