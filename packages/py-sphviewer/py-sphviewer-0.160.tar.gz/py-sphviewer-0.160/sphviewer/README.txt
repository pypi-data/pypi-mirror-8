Py-SPHViewer
=================

Py-SPHViewer is a framework for rendering particles using the Smoothed 
Particles Hydrodynamics written in Python. It was born from my interest in 
making movies of cosmological nbody simulations. Although it is under 
development, we consider that in its current version it can be distributed 
without major warnings and of course without any warranty. The project is 
hosted at https://code.google.com/p/py-sphviewer/. There, you are going to 
find relevant information, tutorials, news and the discussion group.

If you use Py-SPHViewer in any publication, I'll be very happy if you thanks
the project at the end. For any request, comments, or for joining the project,
please contact me.
