   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

``pyte`` users
--------------

Believe it or not, there're projects which actually **need** a terminal emulator
library, not many of them use ``pyte`` though:

* `Selectel <http://selectel.com>`_ -- hey, we wrote this thing :)
* `Ajenti <http://github.com/Eugeny/ajenti>`_ -- easy to use weadmin panel for Linux
  and BSD uses ``pyte`` for its terminal plugin.
* `Neutron IDE <https://github.com/pizzapanther/Neutron-IDE>`_ -- personal cloud
  IDE.


Show me the code!
-----------------

Head over to our brief :ref:`tutorial` or, if you're feeling brave, dive right
into the :ref:`api` -- ``pyte`` also has a couple of
minimal examples in the ``examples/`` directory.
