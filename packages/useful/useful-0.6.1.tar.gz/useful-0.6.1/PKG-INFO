Description: Overview
        ===
        
        `python-useful`: Utilities of everyday use when writing Python 2.7 code
        or Django projects.
        
        This package is used in several living projects. The individual utilities
        contained are usually not depending on each other. Their layout and API
        are considered stable honouring the backward compatibility.
        
        The project is separated into two sections:
        
        - **General Python stuff**
        - **Django-related utils** - located in the `django` package
        
        The code is documented, please find the description and examples
        in the docstring of each utility.
        
        Installation
        ===
        
        Install using [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html):
        
        ```
        $ pip install useful
        ```
        
        Or install from source:

        If you are about to use the Django features like the templatetags,
        you can add to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
        
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'useful.django',
        )
        ```
