        Installation
        ============
        
        Using pip
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install pyguacamole
        
        
        From source
        
        ::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        GuacamoleClient handles communication with a running *guacd* server via `Guacamole Protocol <http://guac-dev.org/doc/gug/protocol-reference.html>`_.
        
        GuacamoleClient must be used by a broker server which handles communication with a Javscript application running in the browser. GuacamoleClient implements the methods that enables communication with guacd server (send & receive).
        
        First step should be establishing *handshake* with guacd server, then
        Broker server should handle instruction sending and receiving:
        
        - **send**: send instruction *to* guacd server
        - **receive**: receive instruction *from* guacd server
        
        ::
        
            >>> from guacamole.client import GuacamoleClient
            >>> client = GuacamoleClient('127.0.0.1', 4822)
            >>> client.handshake(protocol='rdp', hostname='localhost', port=3389)
        
        
        Once instruction is received from guacd server, it should be sent immediately to the browser
        
        ::
        
            >>> instruction = client.receive()
            >>> instruction
            '4.size,1.0,4.1024,3.768;'
        
        and once instruction is sent from browser, it should be sent immediately to guacd server
        
        ::
        
            >>> instruction = '5.mouse,3.400,3.500;'
            >>> client.send(instruction)
