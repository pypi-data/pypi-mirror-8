Description: An extremely simple django app that renders templates based on URL path.
        
        Kenny provides a single view, `SongBirdView` which takes the path url kwarg
        and appends .html to it and serves it. It also rstrips any `/`s. It can also
        take an optional `prefix` kwarg that will be prepended to the redered
        template's path.
        
        `SongBirdView` is a subclass of `django.views.generic.base.TemplateView`, so
        all of it's documentation except for the `template_name` parameter apply.
        
        So basically, to serve the mockups of your website under the `/mockup/` URL
        you can do the following:
        
        ```
        urlpatterns += (
            url(r'^mockup/(?P<path>.*)$', SongBirdView.as_view(prefix='mockup/'))
        )
        ```
        
        This way, if you go to `localhost:8000/mockup/foo/`, your `mockup/foo.html`
        template will be served.
