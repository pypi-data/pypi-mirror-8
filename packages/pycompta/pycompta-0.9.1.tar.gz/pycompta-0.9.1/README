Description
-----------

An accounting tool with "double entries", journal, general ledger, 
work sheet, income statements and balance sheet. Outputed
accounting records can be HTML, XSL:FO and PDF.

All input data is XML. An entry looks like:

::

  <ecriture date="2002-01-01">
     <libelle>Bought an accounting tool</libelle>
     <debit compte="60" montant="81,40" />     <!-- spend -->
     <debit compte="40" montant="19,60" />     <!-- vat -->
     <credit  compte="50" montant="100,00" />  <!-- bank account -->
     <reglement type='CB'> credit card on Jan 1st 2002</reglement>
  </ecriture>


Note: "ecriture" means "entry", "compte" means "account" and
"montant" means "amount". Contribute your own parser if you will.

Data can be edited with a text editor or with the specific
graphical user interface.

Configuration
-------------

Pycompta uses two main directories. The working directory contains
data and the target directory will hold the resulting reports.

In the working directory one will find:
  - the description of the company (here societe.xml)   
  - the list of accounts (named plan-comptable.xml)
  - the XML files describing actual and previsional assets
  - the directories containing the actual entries and the previsional
    entries for the current financial year

Or

::

	/home/compta/data/
	`-- year2003
	    |-- entries
	    `-- entries_prev


Here is an example configuration file (compta.conf)

::

	debut = 200301
	fin = 200301
	fin_prev = 200312


Note: debut means start, fin means end.

Usage
-----

To generate the reports, just run:

	pycompta compta.conf

and have a look at the results in the target directory.


Graphical user interface
