Install PyCompta
----------------

Download
````````

The latest version is available from the download section of

	http://www.logilab.org/projects/pycompta

either as source (tar.gz) or as Debian packages.

Install
```````

If you install from source, a setup.py is provided. This works
with the distutils module available from the Python standard library.

Since pycompta is a pure python module, a simple

	python setup.py install

or

	python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/local

should be enough to get you started.

Try `python setup.py --help` for more info, or read the distutils
documentation.
