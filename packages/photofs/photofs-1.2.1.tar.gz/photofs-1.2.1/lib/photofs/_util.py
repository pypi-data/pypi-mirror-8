def make_unique(mapping, base_name, format_1, format_n, *args):
    """Creates a unique key in a ``dict``.

    First the string ``format_1 % base_name`` is tried. If that is present in
    ``mapping``, the strings ``format_n % ((base_name, n) + args)`` with ``n``
    incrementing from ``2`` are tried until a unique one is found.

    :param str base_name: The name of the file without extension.

    :param str format_1: The initial format string. This will be passed
        ``base_name`` followed by ``args``.

    :param str format_n: The fallback format string. This will be passed
        ``base_name`` followed by an index and then ``args``.

    :param args: Format string arguments used.
