        =======
        
        *photofs* is an application that allows you to mount the tags in the photo
        database from `Shotwell <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell>`_ as directories
        in a virtual file system.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To add directories for all tags under ``$PHOTOFS_PATH``, run the following
        command::
        
            photofs $PHOTOFS_PATH
        
        After this, ``$PHOTOFS_PATH/Photos`` will contain directories for all photo
        tags, and ``$PHOTOFS_PATH/Videos`` will contain directories for all video tags.
        
        Run ``photofs --help`` for a list of all command line arguments.
        
        
        How do I change the names of photos and videos?
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        *photofs* will use the title of an image as file name. If the image does not
        have a title, the exposure time will be used. If more than one image is shot at
        the same time, the file names will be made unique by appending *(1)*, *(2)* etc.
        to the file name.
        
        Run ``photofs --help`` to see how to change the time format used.
