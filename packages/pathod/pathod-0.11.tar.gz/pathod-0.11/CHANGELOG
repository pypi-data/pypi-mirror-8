7 November 2014: pathod 0.11:

  * Hugely improved SSL support, including dynamic generation of certificates
    using the mitproxy cacert
  * pathoc -S dumps information on the remote SSL certificate chain
  * Big improvements to fuzzing, including random spec selection and memoization to avoid repeating randomly generated patterns 
  * Reflected patterns, allowing you to embed a pathod server response specification in a pathoc request, resolving both on client side. This makes fuzzing proxies and other intermediate systems much better.


25 August 2013: pathod 0.9.2:

    * Adapt to interface changes in netlib
    

15 May 2013: pathod 0.9 (version synced with mitmproxy):

    * Pathod proxy mode. You can now configure clients to use pathod as an
      HTTP/S proxy.

    * Pathoc proxy support, including using CONNECT to tunnel directly to
      targets. 

    * Pathoc client certificate support.
    
    * API improvements, bugfixes.


16 November 2012: pathod 0.3:

    A release focusing on shoring up our fuzzing capabilities, especially with
    pathoc.

    * pathoc -q and -r options, output full request and response text.

    * pathod -q and -r options, add full request and response text to pathod's
      log buffer.
    
    * pathoc and pathod -x option, makes -q and -r options log in hex dump
      format.

    * pathoc -C option, specify response codes to ignore.
    
    * pathoc -T option, instructs pathoc to ignore timeouts.
    
    * pathoc -o option, a one-shot mode that exits after the first non-ignored
      response. 
    
    * pathoc and pathod -e option, which explains the resulting message by
      expanding random and generated portions, and logging a reproducible
      specification.

    * Streamline the specification langauge. HTTP response message is now
      specified using the "r" mnemonic.

    * Add a "u" mnemonic for specifying User-Agent strings. Add a set of
      standard user-agent strings accessible through shortcuts.

    * Major internal refactoring and cleanup.
    
    * Many bugfixes.
    

22 August 2012: pathod 0.2:

    * Add pathoc, a pathological HTTP client.
    
    * Add libpathod.test, a truss for using pathod in unit tests.
    
    * Add an injection operator to the specification language.
    
    * Allow Python escape sequences in value literals.
    
    * Allow execution of requests and responses from file, using the new + operator.
    
    * Add daemonization to Pathod, and make it more robust for public-facing use. 
   
    * Let pathod pick an arbitrary open port if -p 0 is specified.
    
    * Move from Tornado to netlib, the network library written for mitmproxy.
    
    * Move the web application to Flask.
    
    * Massively expand the documentation.
