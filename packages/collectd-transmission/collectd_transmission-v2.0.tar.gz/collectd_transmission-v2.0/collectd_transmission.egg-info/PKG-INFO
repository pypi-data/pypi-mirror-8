Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A python plugin for integrating collectd and transmission. With this
        installed, collectd will be querying transmission for the following:
        
        Per session and cumulative:
        
        * downloadedBytes
        * uploadedBytes
        * filesAdded
        * secondsActive
        
        General:
        
        * activeTorrentCount
        * blocklist\_size
        * downloadSpeed
        * uploadSpeed
        * pausedTorrentCount
        * torrentCount
        
        and creating the relevant RRD files (or pushing to graphite or whatever
        you have collectd doing)
        
        Some of these metrics are per session, some session cumulative, some are
        session independent. Their type 'current', 'cumulative', 'general' is set
        in the name of the metric
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        Developed and tested on Debian Wheezy system.
        
        That means:
        
        * collectd 5.1
        * transmissionrpc 0.8
        
        But testing has also been conducted on Debian Jessie systems. Which means:
        
        * collectd 5.4
        * transmissionrpc 0.11
        
        It is expected Debian Jessie will be the main playground soon

        How to install
        ==============
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        Those are collectd and transmission
        
        I assume a Debian system here, amend accordingly for your system
        
        If you have not already installed transmision, install it:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            apt-get install transmission-daemon
        
        The above install the daemon cause a headless box is assumed. It should
        probably work with a non headless box as well and a normal transmission
        installation but this has not been tested.
        
        Install the python transmission binding
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            apt-get install python-transmissionrpc
        
        Install collectd.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            apt-get install collectd
        
        Install collectd_transmission
        -----------------------------
        
        There are two ways to achieve this for now
        
        Use the python package
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install collectd_transmission
        
        Do it manually
        ++++++++++++++
        
        Clone the repo, copy the module directory somewhere in your fileystem
        
        Configure
        =========
        
        Insert the following in your collectd.conf::
        
            <Plugin python>
                ModulePath "/path/to/module/dir" # Not needed if installed via pip or package
                LogTraces false
                Interactive false
                Import "collectd_transmission"
                <Module collectd_transmission>
                    username "myuser" # Required
                    password "mypass" # Required
                    address "http://localhost:9091/transmission/rpc" # Optional, defaults to "http://localhost:9091/transmission/rpc"
                    timeout "5" # Optional, defaults to 5
                </Module>
            </Plugin>
        
        modified accordingly to your needs. Restart collectd and you are done.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sudo service collectd restart
        
        There should be rrds for transmission under collectd's data directory.
        Most probably that is /var/lib/collectd/rrd/<hostname>/transmission/
        
        How to display your data
        ========================
        
        Well if you got collectd, you probably already have a way of displaying
        your data anyway. If you don't there are various frontends available at:
