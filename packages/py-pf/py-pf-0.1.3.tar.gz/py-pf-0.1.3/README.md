py-pf
=====

`py-pf` is a pure-Python module for managing OpenBSD's Packet Filter. It aims
to add powerful and flexible scripting capabilities to PF, making integration
with third-party software (like IDS, web-based configuration interfaces or
custom management scripts) much easier.

It runs on Python 2.7, which is available through OpenBSD's [packages and ports
system](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html).
