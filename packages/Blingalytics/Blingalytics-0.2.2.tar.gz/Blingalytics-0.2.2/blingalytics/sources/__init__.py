"""
In Blingalytics, sources implement an interface between the report and the
original source data.

For example, the database source provides an interface for doing sums and
counts over database columns; the derived source allows you to perform
calculations over columns from other sources; and the merge source allows
you to pull data from other reports and produce a sort of meta-report.

When writing a report, the sources you choose to use will provide you with
some or all of the following:

* **Column types**, which define how and where the source gets the data for
  that column.
* **Filters**, which you or the end user (through user input widgets) can use
  to filter the source data for the report.
* **Key ranges**, which the report uses to determine which rows to produce.

The documentation for each of the sources provides more in-depth information.

Standard column options
-----------------------

Most columns will require or accept certain arguments specific to their use
case, but all column types accept the following optional standard arguments:

* ``format``: A format class or instance that should be used to determine the
  formatting and display options for this column. If omitted, the column
  defaults to being hidden. See :doc:`/formats` for more.
* ``footer``: Most numeric data columns will calculate a sum for the footer
  by default. String data columns have no footer by default. Each column's
  documentation will specify if it has any non-standard footer handling. For
  any column, if you wish to disable the footer, you can set this to
  ``False``.

Standard filter options
-----------------------

Most filters also require or accept arguments specific to their use case, but
all filters accept the following optional standard arguments:

* ``columns``: If one or more columns are provided, the filter should only be
  applied to the given columns. Other columns should remain unaffected. The
  columns may be specified as a string (for just one column) or a list of
  strings, specifying the column names to filter. Defaults to ``None``, which
  applies the filter to all columns in the report.
* ``widget``: A widget class or instance that defines the widget type the user
  should be shown to input a filter argument. Defaults to ``None``. See
  :doc:`/widgets` for more.

    """
    Defines the base interface for a report to access a data source.

    Subclasses should define any or all of the methods: pre_process, get_rows,
    and post_process. The report base class will call these methods at the
    appropriate times to retrieve and process the data from this source.

    The pre_process method is called at the start of the get_rows call to the
    report instance. You can use this method to do any setup or processing to
    prepare for the get_rows call.

    The get_rows method is called by the report instance on all its sources in
    tandem, and they are combined using Python's heapq implementation. See the
    get_rows docstring for a detailed explanation of how to emit the rows.

    The post_process gives each source an opportunity to act on the row values
    as returned by itself and all the other sources. This provides an
    opportunity for the source to do calculations or adjustments based on the
    values returned by another source.

    By default, the Source class stores the report's filters, key ranges, and
    columns, for reference within the source implementation:

    * _filters: The filters list defined on the report.
    * _keys: The normalized list of key ranges on the report.
    * _report_columns: The list of columns defined on the report.
    * _report_columns_dict: A dict version of the report columns that you can
      use when the column order doesn't matter and a dict is more convenient.
    * _columns: The list of columns belonging to this source that are defined
      on the report, in the order they appear.
    * _columns_dict: A dict version of the _columns attribute.

        The formatting and order of the returned rows is hugely important. The
        report instance pulls the iterators for all its sources' get_rows in
        tandem, and combines them into rows using Python's heapq
        implementation.

        Rows should be returned as a tuple of key and partial row. The key is
        a tuple of the values of the report's key columns, in the order they
        are defined in report.keys. (Every source in a report is required to
        return the same keys.) The partial row is a dict of column name to
        value pairs. The rows must be returned in sorted order (by the key
        tuple). For example:

        [
            ((12,), {'date': 12, 'total': 3}),
            ((14,), {'date': 14, 'total': 35}),

        rows (formatted as above) that just contain the key columns. This can
        be useful if the source needs to act upon these values, for example to
        perform database lookups on the values. However, the report is not
        required to use these values and need not even emit a value for each
        key row.

        It is also good practice to process the rows as incrementally as
        possible. Since we are often working with very large data sets, we
        don't want to pull the whole thing into memory all at once. Instead,
        it is often preferable for get_rows to be a generator that processes
        and yields the data in batches.
