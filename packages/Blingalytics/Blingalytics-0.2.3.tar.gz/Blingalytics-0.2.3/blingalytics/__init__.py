"""
The ``blingalytics`` module provides a few utility methods that are useful for
retrieving your reports.

.. note::

    The report registration method is done using a metaclass set on the
    :class:`base.Report` class. This means that the modules where you've
    defined your report classes have to be imported before the methods below
    will know they exist. You can import them when your code initializes, or
    right before you call the utility functions, or whatever â€” just be sure to
    do it.
