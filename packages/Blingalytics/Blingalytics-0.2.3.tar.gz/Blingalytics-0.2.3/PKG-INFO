Description: 
        Blingalytics
        ============
        
        Blingalytics is an open-source Python project for building a flexible,
        powerful business reporting system.
        
        * Define new reports quickly by writing simple Python
        
        * Pluggable data source and caching structure - use the built-in modules or
          write one for your own particular needs
        
        * Output your report data to powerful HTML/JavaScript tables, with paging,
          sorting and more
        
        For the full documentation, please visit it over on `Read the Docs`_. Or if
        you're feeling particularly do-it-yourself today, you can always build the
        docs yourself with Sphinx_.
