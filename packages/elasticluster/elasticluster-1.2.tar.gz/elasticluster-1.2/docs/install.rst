  Installation  
================


`elasticluster` is a `Python`_ program; Python version 2.6 is required
to run it.

The easiest way to install elasticluster is using `pip`_, this will
install the latest **stable** release from the `PyPI`_ website. The
following section: `Installing from PyPI`_ will explain you how to do
it.

If you instead want to test the *development* version, go to the
`Installing from github`_ section.

In both cases, it's strongly suggested to install `elasticluster` in a
`python virtualenv`_, so that you can easily uninstall or upgrade
`elasticluster`.

Installing from PyPI
--------------------

It's quite easy to install `elasticluster` using
`pip`_; the command below is all you
need to install `elasticluster` on your system::

    pip install elasticluster

If you want to run `elasticluster` from source you have to **install**
`Ansible`_ **first:**

::

    pip install ansible
    python setup.py install


Installing from github
----------------------

The source code of elasticluster is `github`_, if you want to test the
latest development version you can clone the `github elasticluster repository`_.

You need the ``git`` command in order to be able to clone it, and we
suggest you to use `python virtualenv`_ in order to create a
controlled environment in which you can install elasticluster as
normal user. 

Assuming you already have ``virtualenv`` installed on your machine,
you first need to create a virtualenv and install `ansible`, which is
needed by elasticluster::

    virtualenv elasticluster
    . elasticluster/bin/activate
    pip install ansible
    
Then you have to download the software. We suggest you to download it
*within* the created virtualenv::

    cd elasticluster
    git clone git://github.com/gc3-uzh-ch/elasticluster.git src
    cd src
    python setup.py install

Now the ``elasticluster`` should be available in your current
environment.

Notes on MacOSX installation
----------------------------

When installing `elasticluster` on MacOSX operating systems you may
get some errors while running `python setup.py install`, because
`pip`_ is not always able to automatically resolve the
dependencies.

In these cases, you need to find the package that is failing and
install it manually using `pip`.

For instance, if during the installation you get something like::

    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_script_header'

you probably need to install `pbr` manually using::

    pip install pbr

In some MacOSX version, even if the installation *seems* to succeed,
you may get the following error the first time you run `elasticluster`::

	

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/michela/el2/bin/elasticluster", line 9, in <module>

      File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-universal/egg/apiclient/errors.py", line 27, in <module>
    ImportError: No module named anyjson

In this case, the issue is caused by `google-api-python-client`, and
you should:
1) uninstall it using `pip uninstall`
2) reinstall it using `pip install`
3) re-run elasticluster installation

::

    pip uninstall google-api-python-client
    [...]
    pip install google-api-python-client
    [...]
    python setup.py install
