----------------------------------------

The simple Mopidy webclient builds on top of the following projects:

- jQuery (the JavaScript library). Licensed under the MIT license, refer to
  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/2.0.2/MIT-LICENSE.txt for details.

- Bootstrap (the CSS framework). The version currently used is licensed under
  the Apache License, refer to https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v2.3.2/LICENSE
  for details.

- sprintf.js. Licensed under the BSD license, refer to
  https://github.com/alexei/sprintf.js/blob/master/LICENSE for details
  (I used http://www.what-license.com/ to identify the license).

- Several icons from the Humanity icon theme included in Ubuntu Linux. The most
  authoritative source for a license I could find was
  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-art-pkg/human-icon-theme/ubuntu/view/head:/COPYING
  which states that the "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License"
  applies. To be honest it's not clear to me if using these icons requires my
  work to be licensed under the same license as well. If it turns out that this
  is true I'd rather find a different icon set, because the CC BY-SA license
  for software doesn't make sense.
