django-bingo 1.5.0 (2014-12-18):
	* improved: header row and number of players column on game list page.
	* new: support for User profiles, with the User's BingoBoards
	  associated to the account. Old BingoBoards can be claimed, if they have
	  a password, which is unique for the old Game.
	* fixed: corrected url regex for numbers, not to match ""
	* fixed: off by one error, causing the bottom/right lines to be 1px too
	  thin.
	* new: optionally use server-sent events for less polling (needs a redis
	  database)
	* improved: added POLLING_INTERVAL / POLLING_INTERVAL_SSE settings to
	  configure how often updated votes / user numbers should be fetched
	* improved: show title text below the board, if javascript is enabled
	* new: the bingo page has now a variable middleword set.
	* improved: Game and BingoBoard now have ``get_absolute_url``, which
	  provides i.e links to the game/bingo page in the admin interface.
	* improved: style fixes ("veto" title tag)
	* improved: added game descriptions to the game list page.

django-bingo 1.4.0 (2014-02-27):
	Attention: when updating from an older version, you will need south
	to migrate the database.
	* new: added a "description" field to Word model, which is shown as
	  title="..." attribute on bingo fields.
	* new: added a "description" field to Game model, which can be set when
	  creating the first board of a game.
	* performance: reduced querys to get the number of votes for a Word in a Game
	* improved: the bingo page is reloaded after the game is expired, so it
	  stops polling for new votes.
	* performance: update the last_used timestamp with .update() instead of
	  .save(), which avoids saving the whole object, when only the timestamp
	  has changed.
	* performance: reduced number of queries when creating board lists.
	* style: some style fixes.
	* new: option to rate the show (not the board!)
	* improved: [-] veto buttons are now toggle buttons (veto/neutral)

	  added to the theme switcher, when the dark theme is the default THEME.
	* improved: title-text for board thumbnails with creation time. alt-text
	  with board_id.
	* improved: board thumbnails switch between voted / marked on mouseover.
	* new: VOTE_START_TIME allows to set a time between GAME_START_TIMES[0]
	  and GAME_END_TIME, after which voting will be activated. This can be
	  used to allow board creation before the game starts, but disable early
	  votes.
	* new: added a footer.

	* fix: each BingoBoard was missing one of the words, which are not on the board.

	  * THEMES = (('name', 'path/to/file.css'), ...) are themes shown in a theme chooser
	  * new dark theme included. use "bingo/themes/dark.css" as path.
