This module contains 2 functions that can be used during general Python code development.

unnest
Given a list of nested lists and/or nested tuples (a complex nested structure of list/tuples that is not known), this function will extract and return single elements only (strings, floats, integers) that were inside these list and/or tuple structures.

list2dict
Given a list of strings that may or may not be duplicated, this function outputs a dictionary having keys equal to the unique strings in the list and values equal to the number of times the string is repeated in the list (count).
