Description: Carpenter
        =========
        
        A Python repository which repairs and analyzes tablular data
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        This module provides the capability to extract and repair blocks of data
        from 2D tables. These blocks can then be individually processed,
        stitched together, or filtered as needed by a particular program.
        
        Autoconversions of cells along with a multi-tier flagging system for
        each magnitude of change allows for a wide variety of error handling.
        Additionally missing titles can be repaired from surrounding cells in
        order to generate compelete blocks from implied headings.
