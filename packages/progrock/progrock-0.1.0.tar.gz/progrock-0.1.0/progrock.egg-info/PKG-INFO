        Installation
        ------------
        progrock may be installed via the Python package index with the tool of
        your choice. I prefer pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install progrock

        Requirements
        ------------
        There are no requirements outside of the Python standard library.
        
        Example
        -------
        The following example will create a process for each CPU core on the system
        that it is run on, displaying the MultiProgress screen. The child processes
        will iterate 100 times, updating their progress bar and then sleeping up to
        1 second.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import progrock
            import random
        
            def example_runner(ipc_queue):
                # Update the processes status in its progress box
                progrock.set_status(ipc_queue, 'Running')
        
                # Increment the progress bar, sleeping up to one second per iteration
                for iteration in range(1, 101):
                    progrock.increment(ipc_queue)
                    time.sleep(random.random())
        
            processes = []
        
            # Create the MultiProgress instance
            with progrock.MultiProgress('Example') as progress:
        
                # Spawn a process per CPU and append it to the list of processes
                for proc_num in range(0, multiprocessing.cpu_count()):
                    processes.append(progress.new_process(example_runner))
        
                # Wait for the processes to run
                while any([p.is_alive() for p in processes]):
                    time.sleep(1)
