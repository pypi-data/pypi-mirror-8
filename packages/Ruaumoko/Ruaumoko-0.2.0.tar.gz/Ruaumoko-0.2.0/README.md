A Python module and web API for worldwide elevation data.

This project is a part of the larger [Tawhiri Landing Predictor
Software](https://github.com/cuspaceflight/tawhiri).

The digital elevation data is sourced from the [Viewfinder
Panoramas](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html) website.

See the CUSF wiki for more details: http://www.cusf.co.uk/wiki/ruaumoko.

## Dependencies

Python dependences may be found in `requirements.txt`. To run the downloader
you will also require the `convert` command (from `imagemagick`).

## Running a development webserver

The ``ruaumoko-api`` command can be used to run a development web server.

```console
$ ruaumoko-api runserver
```

This will use the default configuration. To use a custom configuration to, for
example, change the dataset location and enable debugging use the
``RUAUMOKO_SETTINGS`` environment variable:

```console
$ cat > ruaumoko-development.txt <<EOL
ELEVATION_DIRECTORY = '/path/to/your/dataset'
DEBUG = True
EOL
$ RUAUMOKO_SETTINGS=ruaumoko-development.txt ruaumoko-api runserver
```

## Dataset Format

Throughout Ruaumoko, data is indexed latitude-first/row-first

The 15-arcsecond (i.e., dividing a degree into 240 points) data comes as a
grid of 24 TIFs, named A-X (C layout).
Each TIF is a 10801 by 14401 array of 16 bit signed integers.
The download script concatenates the arrays (after unpacking the TIFs) to get
a single binary file, which is cast to an array with dimensions
`(4, 6, 10801, 14401)`.

Note that `4 * 10800 = 180 * 240` and `6 * 14400 = 360 * 240`.

Each TIF overlaps with the ones on each side by one row, that is, the 10801th
row of 'A' is the same as the 1st row of chunk 'G'.

The top left corner of chunk A is at (lat) 90 (lng) -180. Latitude decreases
down the rows; longitude increases along the columns.
