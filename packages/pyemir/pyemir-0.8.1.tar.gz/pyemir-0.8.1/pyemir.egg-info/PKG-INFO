        PyEmir requires the following packages installed in order to
        be able to be installed and work properly:
        
         - setuptools (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools)
         - numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/) 
         - scipy (http://www.scipy.org)
         - astropy (http://www.astropy.org/)
         - numina (http://guaix.fis.ucm.es/hg/numina)
         - photutils (https://github.com/sergiopasra/photutils/tree/numpy18) [1]
        
        EMIR is a wide-field, near-infrared, multi-object spectrograph proposed 
        for the Nasmyth focus of GTC. It will allow observers to obtain from tens to 
        hundreds of intermediate resolution spectra simultaneously, in the 
        nIR bands Z, J, H and K. A multi-slit mask unit will be used for target acquisition. 
        EMIR is designed to address the science goals of the proposing team and 
        of the Spanish community at large.
