PyEmir Documentation
====================

Welcome. This is the Documentation for PyEmir (version |version|), 

EMIR is a **wide-field, near-infrared, multi-object spectrograph** proposed 
for the Nasmyth focus of GTC_. It will allow observers to obtain from **tens to hundreds of 
intermediate resolution spectra simultaneously**, in the nIR bands *Z, J, H* and  *K*. 
A multi-slit mask unit will be used for target acquisition. EMIR is designed 
to address the science goals of the proposing team and of the Spanish community at large.
