av2hdf5 is small utility which can pull video frames out of any
FFMPEG-compatible video format and insert them as separate datasets within an
HDF5 file. Each frame may be stored uncompressed or as a one-dimensional array
of bytes representing the JPEG or PNG encoding.

This utility is probably of use to those performing batch scientific computing
on images with software which expects HDF5-formatted input.
