"""The :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.jobs` package provides data
definitions for managing so-called job supply projects.

    A job supply project is when the PCSW arranges a job for a client,
    with the aim to bring this person back into the social security
    system and the employment process. In most cases, the PSWC acts as
    the legal employer.  It can employ the person in its own services
    (internal contracts) or put him/her at the disposal of a third
    party employer (external contracts).

    (Adapted from `mi-is.be
    <http://www.mi-is.be/en/public-social-welfare-centers/article-60-7>`_).

This module is technically similar to :mod:`ISIP <isip>` which it
extends.
