Description: Python Env Wrapper is a set of tools to manage multiple virtual environments. The tools can create, delete and copy your environments, using a single command to switch to them wherever you are, while keeping them in a single (configurable) location.
        
        Pew makes it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies. It is written in pure python and leverages inve: the idea/alternative implementation of a better activate script.
        
        The advantage is that pew doesn't hook into a shell, but is only a set of commands that is thus completely shell-agnostic:
        
        It works on bash, zsh, fish, powershell, etc.
