Thank you for downloading wger Workout Manager. wger is a free, open source web
application that manages your exercises and personal workouts, weight and diet
plans. I can also be used as a simple gym management utility, providing different
administrative roles (trainer, manager, etc.). It offers a REST API as well, for
easy integration with other projects and tools.

It is written with python/django and uses jQuery and some D3js for charts.

For more details and a live system, refer to the project's site: https://wger.de/
