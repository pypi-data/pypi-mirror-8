A script for importing GPX files into a SpatiaLite database.

Uses Tomo Krajina's gpx module. gpx2spatialite takes a single or
folder full of gpx files and imports them into a spatialite spatial
database. On importing, a file is hashed and entered into a table
to make sure that a file with identical contents is not added
twice. The spatial information from trackpoints is stored in two
tables in the spatialite database, trackpoints and tracklines which
are related. You can read more detail about the reason to represent
data from a GPX file like this here:
<http://planbperformance.net/dan/blog/?p=984>

The compulsory 'user' argument is to import gpx files from
different users into the same database. This is because
gpx2spatialite was written as an importer for DrawingLife
<https://github.com/ptrv/drawinglife> which is a visualisation
software written by Peter Vasil for Daniel Belasco Rogers' and
Sophia New's art project of recording everywhere they go with a GPS
since 2003 and 2007 respectively (<http://belasconew.com/works/lifedrawing/>)

If you only have one user to enter, just pick any name and import
all files under this name.

Because DrawingLife has text at the top of the screen which shows
the current location of the animation screen, this information is
provided by the citydef_uid column in the trackpoints table which
points to the citydefs table. This column is also populated on
import by default. If you do not require this, you can set the
option -s --skip-locations which will speed up importing
considerably.

Dependencies
------------

Linux and Mac
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Python:

  * gpxpy
  * pyspatialite, pysqlite2 (with support for loading extensions)

* Other libraries:

  * libspatialite
  * libsqlite


Installation
------------

Linux and Mac
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

gpx2spatialite is available via pip.
You can simply run::

  pip install gpx2spatialite

Or to install it with user scope run the following command::

  pip install gpx2spatialite --user

Make sure that ``$HOME/.local/bin`` is available in your ``PATH`` environment variable.
Otherwise the gpx2spatialite executable will not be found when you run it from the shell::

  PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin


Windows
^^^^^^^

* Download python 2.7 32bit for windows
* Install pip. (See instructions `here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_)
* Install gpxpy with ``pip install gpxpy``
* Download mod_spatialte from http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/windows-bin-x86/
  and extract all dlls to ``C:\Python27\Scripts``
* Download sqlite3.dll from `sqlite website <http://www.sqlite.org/download.html>`_
  (something like 'sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3080704.zip')
  and overwrite ``sqlite3.dll`` in ``C:\Python27\Scripts\DLLs`` with the downloaded version
  (This ensures that ``sqlite3.dll`` is capable of loading extensions)
* Install gpx2spatialite with ``pip install gpx2spatialite``


Usage
-----

It is possible to read in single files::

  gpx2spatialite import -d <path/to/database> -u <user_id> <path/to/gpx>

Or multiple folders::

  gpx2spatialite import -d <path/to/database> -u <user_id> <path/to/folder1> <path/to/folder2>

Files and folders can be specified both at the same time::

  gpx2spatialite import -d <path/to/database> -u <user_id> <path/to/folder1> <path/to/gpx>


Create a new database
---------------------

Run script with subcommand to create a new database and initialize it::

  gpx2spatialite create_db <path/to/new/database>


CityDefs
--------

Each trackpoint has a location assigned to it which is used for the
`drawinglife <https://github.com/ptrv/drawinglife>`_ animation.

These are defined at import time unless the option `-s` or
`--skip-locations` is passed.

Locations are defined in the `citydefs` table in the database, created
and populated automatically by running 'gpx2spatialite create_db'.

Import citydefs into existing database::

  gpx2spatialite citydefs -i <path/to/input.sql> <path/to/database>

Export citydefs table::

  gpx2spatialite citydefs -e <path/to/output.sql> <path/to/database>

After adding new locations to the citydefs table, you can look for
currently unknown trackpoints and assign them to any relevant,
newly defined locations with::

  gpx2spatialite update_locs <path/to/database>

If you have redefined currently assigned locations or completely
changed the citydefs table, you will want to redefine every
trackpoint in the database, for which you use the `-a` or
`-all-locations` option to the above script::

  gpx2spatialite update_locs -a <path/to/database>


Unit tests
----------

The repository contains the standalone py.test (version 2.5.2) script
`runtests.py`.

Run the following command to run the tests::

  python setup.py test
