What is `dockerfly`:
========================

dockerfly is a small Docker tool to help you to create container with independent macvlan Eths easily.

use dokerfly, you can:

* create a container with one or more macvlan eths by json config file easily,and set independent ip for each veth

* exec command within contianer by nsenter easily

* create a container with sshd service ,then you can visit the container as the same as a normal virtual machine

Install:
========================

* Linux and Docker. I have tested with Docker versions 1.1.0 through 1.3.1, but other versions should work too. Linux kernels after 3.5 are known to work; the newer the better.

* [nsenter](https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter):

    ```
    docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/nsenter
    ```

*  dockerfly:
    ```
    pip install dockerfly
    ```

How to use:
========================

* generate a sample config json:

    ```
    dockerflyctl gen centos6.json
    ```

you'll get a sample config, cenos6.json:

    ```
    [
        {
            "gateway": "192.168.159.2",
            "eths": [
                [
                    "testDockerflyv0",
                    "eth0",
                    "192.168.159.10/24"
                ],
                [
                    "testDockerflyv1",
                    "eth0",
                    "192.168.159.11/24"
                ]
            ],
            "image_name": "centos:centos6",
            "run_cmd": "/bin/sleep 300"
        }
    ]
    ```

this means:
    * you will create a container with two macvlan eths(testDockerflyv0:192.168.159.10/24, testDockerflyv1:192.168.159.11/24), the eths will link to eth0
    * the container's image name is centos:centos6

* start this container:

    ```
     dockerflyctl run centos6.json
    ```
output:

    ```
    Container running:ContainerId(e3974de549891f15e448c4cb0b1b36706b7a233e0d79073a3f4677b3586a4dcb) Pid(28437)
    ```

exec `docker ps`, you can find:

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                    COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    e3974de54989        172.16.11.13:5000/brain/centos6:latest   "/bin/sleep 300"    2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                            dockerfly_centos_centos6_20141207121837


* set a simple httpserver by nsenter:

    ```
      nsenter -t 28247 -n python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
    ```

now you can visit `http://192.168.159.10` in Physical HostA.

Best Practice:
========================

dockerfly help you to create containers which shared local network by physical hosts, so the easiest way to use dockerfly is to create a container with sshd service.Then you can visit the container as the same as normal virtual machine.

steps:

* pull a sshd image

    ```
    docker pull memorybox/centos6_sshd
    ```

this is a clean image with sshd service and the default user/password is `root:rootroot`, [more info](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/memorybox/centos6_sshd/)

* start the container by dockerfly:

    * create a config file: `dockerfly gen centos6_sshd.json`, modify to:

    ```
    [
        {
            "gateway": "192.168.159.2",
            "eths": [
                [
                    "testDockerflyv0",
                    "eth0",
                    "192.168.159.10/24"
                ],
                [
                    "testDockerflyv1",
                    "eth0",
                    "192.168.159.11/24"
                ]
            ],
            "image_name": "docker.cn/memorybox/centos6_sshd",
            "run_cmd": "/run.sh"
        }
    ]
    ```

    * start container: `dockerflyctl run centos6_sshd.json`

* now you can exec `ssh 192.168.159.10` to connect container in PhysicalHostA.

Caveats
========================
Enable sshd service in docker is unsafe, see here:

http://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/06/23/docker-ssh-considered-evil/

but different people use Docker for different purposes, so  **Don't be afraid, but be careful.**
