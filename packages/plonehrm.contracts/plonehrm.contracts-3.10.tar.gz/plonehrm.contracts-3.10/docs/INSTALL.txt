plonehrm.contracts Installation
===============================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install plonehrm.contracts``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Copy the files called ``plonehrm/contracts/plonehrm.contracts-configure.zcml`` 
   and ``plonehrm/contracts/plonehrm.contracts-meta.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory. 
   (Skip it if they don't exist, in this case this note will need
   to be updated.)
