**models** is a small library implementing some specific algorithms for learning forward and inverse models, most specifically Locally Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR).

It was created to support code for  [experiments on sensorimotor learning](http://fabien.benureau.com). It might somehow be useful to you, especially if you want to rerun, check or tweak the aforementioned experiments.

Its documentation although somehow existent, is notably incomplete and outdated. However, care it taken to keep tests and usage examples functioning.
