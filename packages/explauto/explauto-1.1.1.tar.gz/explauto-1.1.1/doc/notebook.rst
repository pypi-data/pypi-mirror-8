IPython notebooks
-----------------

Most of Explauto's documentation has been written as `IPython notebooks <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ as it is a very convenient way to describe the code side by side with examples. Furthermore, it allows you not only to read the examples but also to modify, play, and tweak them.

Our github `repository <https://github.com/flowersteam/explauto>`_ contains a `notebook folder <https://github.com/flowersteam/explauto/tree/master/notebook>`_ with all the notebook examples (with their associated exercise solutions). The list of all the available notebook tutorial can be seen on the `github repository front page <https://github.com/flowersteam/explauto#tutorials>`_.
 
You can directly view them on `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/flowersteam/explauto/tree/master/notebook/>`_. Yet, to actually run them on your computer you will need to download them. You can:

* either run them from the notebook folder of your local copy of the repository::

    cd explauto/notebook
    ipython notebook

* or you can directly download them from the nbviewer interface.

For details on installing the packages recquired for running ipython notebook, please refer to the `official documentation <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_.
