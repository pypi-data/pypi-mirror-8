GoogleApiPython3x
=================

This is an unofficial port to Python 3.x of the python client library for Google's discovery based APIs. It is a work-in-progress, feel free to contribute.

The current (3.1) version now features working basic OAuth functionality and Google API functionality, as verified by passing the associated pyunit tests that came with the original Python 2.x code. Some is still untested, so use at your own risk.


Installation
============

To install, simply use pip:

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/enorvelle/GoogleApiPython3x.git

See the Developers Guide for more detailed instructions and documentation:
