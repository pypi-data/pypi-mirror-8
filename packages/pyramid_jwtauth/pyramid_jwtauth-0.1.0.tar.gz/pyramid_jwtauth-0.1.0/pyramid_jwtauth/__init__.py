    """Pyramid Authentication Policy implementing JWT Access Auth.

    This class provides an IAuthenticationPolicy implementation based on
    signed requests, using the JSON Web Token Authentication standard.

    The plugin can be customized with the following arguments:

        * find_groups:  a callable taking a userid and a Request object, and
                        returning a list of the groups that userid is a
                        member of.

        * master_secret:  a secret known only by the server, used for signing
                          JWT auth tokens in the default implementation.

        * private_key:  An RSA private_key
        * private_key_file: a file holding an RSA encoded (PEM/DER) key file.

        * public_key:  An RSA public_key
        * public_key_file: a file holding an RSA encoded (PEM/DER) key file.

        * algorithm:  The algorithm used to sign the key (defaults to HS256)

        * leeway:  The default leeway (as a datetime.timedelta). Defaults to
                   None

        * userid_in_claim: The claim that the userid can be found in.  Normally
                           this is the 'sub' claim of the JWT, but this can
                           be overridden here.  This is used in
                           authenticated_userid() and related functions.

    The library takes either a master_secret or private_key/public_key pair.
    In the later case the algorithm must be an RS* version.
