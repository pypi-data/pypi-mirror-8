"""Plug-in system

Works similar to how OSs look for executables; i.e. a number of
absolute paths are searched for a given match. The predicate for
executables is whether or not an extension matches a number of
options, such as ".exe" or ".bat".

In this system, the predicate is whether or not a fname starts
with "validate" and ends with ".py"
