Description: solid
        =====
        A state machine implementation for Python --- which *isn't* solely designed to parse strings!
        
        
        why state machines?
        ------------------
        They're cool! Also, easy to reason about --- a state machine design enables you
        to compartmentalize responsibilites in a way that functions simply don't.
        
        
        why "solid"?
        ------------
        It's a convoluted name: it's a state machine library written in python;
        snake is another word for python that sounds like state --- and Solid Snake is
        a fairly well known character who kicks serious butt. Thus, "solid".
