Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an AMQP middle-ware for communication with Aleph. `Aleph <http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/Aleph>`_ is a system used in libraries to store meta-data about books and
        authors.
        
        `Full module documentation <http://edeposit-amqp-aleph.readthedocs.org>`_ is hosted at the ReadTheDocs.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Module is hosted at `PYPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_, and can be easily installed using `PIP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_%28package_manager%29>`_:
        
        ::

        Module provides several submodules:
        
        edeposit.amqp.aleph.__init__
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        Data structures for (generic, not just AMQP) communication. It contains reaction function ``reactToAMQPMessage()``, which detects what (serialized) structure was given to her, do some low-level interactions with Aleph and returns result structures.
        
        Module provides also serialize/deserialze functions for generic python ``namedtuple`` structures.
        
        edeposit.amqp.aleph.aleph
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++
        Used for raw communication with Aleph server. Communication is read-only and uses special API provided by Aleph X-Services module.
        
        Can be queried using ``reactToAMQPMessage()`` defined in ``__init__``.
        
        edeposit.amqp.aleph.marcxml
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        MARC XML (de)serialization class, which provides some higher-level bindings to MARC records.
        
        edeposit.amqp.aleph.convertor
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        Convertor from MARC XML records to Epublication structures defined in ``__init__``.
        
        edeposit.amqp.aleph.isbn
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++
        ISBN checksum validator.
        
        Can be queried using ``reactToAMQPMessage()`` defined in ``__init__``.
        
        Acceptance tests
        ----------------
        
        `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org/>`__ is used to test the sources, which are stored in ``src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests`` directory.
        
        You can run them manually (from the root of the package):
        
        ::
        
            $ pybot -W 80 --pythonpath src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests/:src src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests/
        
        Or continuously using nosier:
        
        ::
        
            $ nosier -p src -b 'export' "pybot -W 80 --pythonpath src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests/ --pythonpath src src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests/"
        
        Command to run the test is wrapped in ``run_tests.sh`` in the root of the project.
        
        Status of acceptance tests
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        You can see the results of the tests here:

        http://edeposit-amqp-aleph.readthedocs.org/cs/latest/\_downloads/report.html
        
        Results are currently (12.03.2014) outdated, but some form of continuous integration framework will be used in the future.
