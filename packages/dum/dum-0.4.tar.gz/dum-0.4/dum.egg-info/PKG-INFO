        Introduction
        ############
        
        With the :mod:`dum` module you can easily map data from structured files
        to a set of python classes. 
        The current version can be used with json, csv or xlm formats, 
        more are expected to come.
        
        
        Parsing and projecting
        ======================
        
        The main idea is that your code is designed with objects that share more or less the same
        organization than the data in the original file.  With a few directives, it must then be possible 
        to directly project the data parsed from the file to the class model of your application.
        
        For sample a minimal (all the display methods are still to write...)  `Atom <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29>`_ application
        could look like 
        
        .. code-block:: python
            
            class Author:
                class dum: 
                    name =""
                    email=""
         
            class Link:
                class dum:
                    rel=""
                    href=""
        
            class Entry:
                class dum:
                    title = ""
                    author = [Author]
                    link = [Link]
                    updated = dateutil.parser.parse
        
            class Atom:
                class dum:
                    title =""
                    subtitle= ""
                    entry = [Entry]
                    link = [Link]
                    updated = dateutil.parser.parse
                
            atom = dum.xml(Atom, open("myrss"))
