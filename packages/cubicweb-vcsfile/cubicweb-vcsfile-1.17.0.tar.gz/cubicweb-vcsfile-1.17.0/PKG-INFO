Description: Summary
        -------
        
        This cube stores the data found in a version content manager
        repository. It currently works with subversion or mercurial
        repository.
        
        It doesn't access to the data directly. All the repository's metadata
        (eg revision, file names, commit message, date and autor, etc) are
        stored as entities, and thus queryable via RQL, while actual files
        content is kept in the repository and fetched from there on demand.
