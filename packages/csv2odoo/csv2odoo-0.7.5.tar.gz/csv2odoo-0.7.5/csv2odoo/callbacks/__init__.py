Callbacks module
****************

A callback is a field's value pre-process. It can be used for various treatments,
such as striping, splitting, injecting data relative to the initial value, etc.

.. note::

    Import the callback method and call it properly into the ``callbacks`` argument
    of a :class:`Field <csv2odoo.models.field.Field>` instanciation.

    Concretely, it's such as simple as that.

    .. code-block:: python

        from csv2odoo import callbacks as cb

        Model('res.parter_address', [
            Field('partner_id', columns=[25], callbacks=[cb.get_id('res.partner', ['name'])]),
        ]


Creating a callback
===================

.. autoclass:: csv2odoo.callbacks.callback_model
    :members:
    :inherited-members:


Understanding the process
=========================

Here is the position of callbacks in the mapping hierarchy (Depending of your
configuration, of course).

Preconfigured callbacks
=======================

.. automodule:: csv2odoo.callbacks.preconfigured
    :members:

"""
from csv2odoo.callbacks.preconfigured import *

def callback_model(session, model, field, line):
    """Model for the specifics callbacks class signature.

    :param session: Current :class:`Session <csv2odoo.models.session.Session>`
    :param model: Current :class:`Model <csv2odoo.models.model.Model>`
    :param field: Current :class:`Field <csv2odoo.models.fields.Field>`
    :param line: Current line number

    You can use a closure method to add specific arguments to your callback call.

    .. code-block:: python

        def my_callback(*args, **kwargs):
            \"\"\" Add some arguments to your callback

            \"\"\"
            def _callback(session, model, field, line):
