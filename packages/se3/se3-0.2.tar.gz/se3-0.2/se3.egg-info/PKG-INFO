Description: Special Euclidian 3-space (SE3)
        ===============================
        
        Special euclidian 3-space is the world in which we live, dealing with 3D
        position and orientation (so technically more than 3 dimensions, but
        thats why its *special*).
        
        The ``SE3`` class allows us to do typical transformations easily with
        multiplication of the class instances, as well as visualize the
        coordinate frame.
