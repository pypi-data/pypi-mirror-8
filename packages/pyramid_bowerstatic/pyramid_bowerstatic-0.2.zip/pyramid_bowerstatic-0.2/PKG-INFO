Description: pyramid_bowerstatic: BowerStatic integration for Pyramid
        ========================================================
        
        pyramid_bowerstatic integrates BowerStatic_ into Pyramid_.
        
        When you create a pyramid app, make sure to include pyramid_bowerstatic::
        
            config.include('pyramid_bowerstatic')
        
        Resources can be added to the bowerstatic repository by::
        
            components = pyramid_bowerstatic.create_components('myapp', os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'bower_components'))
        
        
        And resources can be used in views by::
        
            request.include(components, 'jquery')
        
        
        Resource can also be inserted in the view/template directly by using::
        
           request.get_bowerstatic_url('myapp', 'jquery', 'jquery.js')

        ================
        
        - With the release of bowestatic 0.6 it can be used as tweens.
          As a consequence bower.wrap is not needed anymore. Which
          makes it pyramid_bowerstatic easier to use.
