def micro_pyawk(filename, search, results=None, debug=None, postdebug=None):
    """
    Small awk-mimicking search routine.

    'file' is file to search through.
    'search' is the "search program", a list of lists/tuples with 3 elements;
    i.e. [[regex,test,run],[regex,test,run],...]
    'results' is a an object that your search program will have access to for
    storing results.

    Here regex is either as a Regex object, or a string that we compile into a
    Regex. test and run are callable objects.

    This function goes through each line in filename, and if regex matches that
    line *and* test(results,line)==True (or test == None) we execute
    run(results,match),where match is the match object from running
    Regex.match.

    The default results is an empty dictionary. Passing a results object let
    you interact with it in run() and test(). Hence, in many occasions it is
    thus clever to use results=self.
