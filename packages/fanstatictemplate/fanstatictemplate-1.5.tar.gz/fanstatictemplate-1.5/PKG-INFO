        Introduction
        ============
        
        The Fanstatic paster template is used to create Fanstatic python packages.
        Fanstatic packages wrap static resources, such as javascript and CSS libraries.
        
        For more information on Fanstatic, visit http://fanstatic.org.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        After installing the ``fanstatictemplate`` package, a paster template is made
        available::
        
          $ paster create -t fanstatic
        
        When running the ``paster create`` command, you will be asked to supply the name
        of the Fanstatic package and the name, version and URL of the wrapped library.
        
        We use the ``js`` namespace for creating javascript packages, for example
        `jQuery`_ is made available as the ``js.jquery`` python package.
        
        After running the ``paster create`` command, copy the library into the
        newly created ``resources`` subdirectory and register the Resources
        in ``__init__.py``.
        A doctest stub is created. It is up to you to make the tests pass based on the
        newly registered Resources.
        
        .. _`jQuery`: http://jquery.com/
