Introduction
============

This library packages `${library_name}`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`${library_name}`: ${library_url}

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``${project}``) are published to some URL.
