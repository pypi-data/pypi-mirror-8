Description: # Floresta - VPC automation tool
        
        ## Installing
        
        ```sh

        ## Creating the whole VPC
        
        it takes around 10 minutes to create a brand new VPC from scratch: all
        the security groups, subnets, route tables, ec2 instances, internet
        gateway, stitch them together and run their ansible playbooks, if you want to.
        
        
        ```sh
        # supposing that you keep your vpc yaml files inside of ./vpcs/
        
        floresta vpcs/myvpc.yml
        ```
