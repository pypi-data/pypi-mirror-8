        ========
        
        mathjspy is a Python library evaluate mathematical expressions in the same manner as MathJS.
        
        The purpose is to allow calculation of expressions in python that are consistent with what is calculated through
        MathJS.
        
        Many thanks to MathJS for their hard work in developing an excellent mathematical expression interpreter.
