GeoTiler is a library to create maps using tiles from a map provider.

The main goal of the library is to enable a programmer to create maps using
tiles downloaded from OpenStreetMap, Stamen or other map provider.

The maps can be used by interactive applications or to create data analysis
graphs.

The code is based on `Python port <https://github.com/stamen/modestmaps-py>`_ of
`Modest Maps <http://modestmaps.com/>`_ project, which is
licensed under BSD license. All subsequent changes are licensed under GPL
v3 license.
