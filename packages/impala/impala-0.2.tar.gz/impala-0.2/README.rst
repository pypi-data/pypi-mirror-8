   Lines beginning with ".." are reST directives.
   "foo_" or "`foo bar`_" is a link, defined at ".. _foo" or

   "::" introduces a literal block (usually some form of code).
   "`foo`" is some kind of identifier.
   Suspicious backslashes in the text ("`std::string`\s") are required

Overview
========

Impala is a PEP302_ protocol (`sys.meta_path` hook for the `import`
statement) implementation allowing the user to import packages and
modules from arbitrarily named directories and files.

.. _PEP302: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/


Motivation
==========

* Comfort and freedom in development
* Installed interface available without installation

Let's say I'm developing a Python package called `pyoneer`.  I want to
lay the source code out like this: ::

  README.txt
  src/
    __init__.py
    some.py
    more.py
  tests/
    ...

The question then is, how do I `import pyoneer` in the test files
(`<workdir>/tests/...`) and have it load `<workdir>/src/__init__.py`?
The default `import` mechanism requires packages to live in eponymous
directories.

What's the fuss about, you ask?  I should simply rename the `src`
directory to `pyoneer` or maybe `src/pyoneer`, no?

Indeed, this would be tolerable, at least with top-level packages.
However, if I'm working on something that will be available as
`foo.bar.baz` after installation, I certainly don't want to wade
through the desolate `src/foo/bar` to get to the source code.

Maybe I could `import src` in the tests instead?  Well, tests are
a form of documentation, and doubly so with `doctest`_.  "Proper"
documentation (README.txt, etc) can also contain snippets which
should be verifiable without the CUT being installed.

*Impala* to the rescue!

::

  from os.path import abspath, dirname
  import impala

  root = abspath(dirname(__file__))

  impala.register(dict(
    pyoneer = '%s/src' % root
  ))

  import pyoneer

.. _doctest: http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html


Description
===========

`impala.register(aliases)`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`aliases` is a `dict` mapping from fully-qualified module/package
names to paths to load from.  To import a package `p` from path
`/a/b/c`, `aliases` must include the key `p` with associated value
`/a/b/c`, and `/a/b/c/__init__.py` must be a valid package entry
point.  To import a module `m` from path `/f/g/h.py`, `aliases` must
include the key `m` with associated value `/f/g/h.py`.

Example: ::

  from os.path import abspath, dirname
  import impala

  r = dirname(abspath(__file__))

  impala.register({
    'p': '%s/a/b/c' % r,
    'p.q': '%s/f/g/h' % r,
    'p.q.m': '%s/k.py' % r,
  })

  import p
  import p.q
  import p.q.m
