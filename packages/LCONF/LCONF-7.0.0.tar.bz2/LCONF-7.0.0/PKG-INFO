        About
        =====
        `LCONF` stands for L(ight) CONF(iguration) a light - human-friendly, simple readable data serialization format for dynamic
        configuration.
        
        .. important:: REPLACEMENT
        
           - in many situations `LCONF` is a suitable replacement for `YAML <http://www.yaml.org/>`_
           - `LCONF` can be used to replace `JSON <http://json.org/>`_ in many cases
        
        .. note::
        
           - LCONF python library is much faster than PyYAML 3.11
           - LCONF python library emits much faster than the python included json (c extension) defaults
           - LCONF python library parses a little bit faster than the python included json (c extension) using an OrderedDict
           - LCONF python library parses still much slower than the python included json (c extension) defaults
