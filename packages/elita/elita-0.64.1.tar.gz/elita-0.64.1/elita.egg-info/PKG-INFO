Description: Elita
        =====
        
        Elita is an engine/framework for continuous deployment (Deployment as a Service) and API-driven infrastructure utilizing git
        and salt. Elita maps build packages to filesystem locations on an arbitrary number of remote servers and allows deployment
        (and more) via RESTful HTTP calls.

        0.64.1
            - Deployment list now has optional "details" parameter. If "true", all deployment detail will be included in output.
            - More logging for gitdeploy (de-)initialization.
            - Fixes for JSON patch support.
        
        0.64.0
            - All endpoints now support JSON Patch documents (RFC 6902) for the PATCH verb. This is the only way to (for example)
            remove nested object keys. See docs for details.
            - Added username of triggering user to Deployment object (GET /app/{appname}/deployment/{deployment_id})
            - Internal data layer reorganization, bug fixes
