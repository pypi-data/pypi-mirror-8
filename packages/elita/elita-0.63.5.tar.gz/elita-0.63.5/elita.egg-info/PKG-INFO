Description: Elita
        =====
        
        Elita is an engine/framework for continuous deployment (Deployment as a Service) and API-driven infrastructure utilizing git
        and salt. Elita maps build packages to filesystem locations on an arbitrary number of remote servers and allows deployment
        (and more) via RESTful HTTP calls.

        0.63.5
            - Fix authentication for application container endpoint (GET /app):
                * GET - application list will only show applications for which user has at least read permission
                * DELETE - request will succeed iff user has write permission for the requested application
                * PUT - request will succeed iff user has '_global' write permission (admin privileges, essentially)
                * (previously user required '_global' permissions for all verbs)
        
        0.63.4
            - Fix computed user permissions endpoint (applications was blank) (GET /global/users/{username}/permissions)
            - Fix gitdeploy endpoint exception (GET /app/{appname}/gitdeploys/{gitdeploy_name})
        
        0.63.3
            - Don't allow users to change their own permissions
        
        0.63.2
            - Fix ability for admin or other user with admin permissions to view user object endpoints (GET /global/users/{username})
            - Change output format of user endpoint to be consistent with other objects (JSON response has top-level "user" key instead of "message")
        
        0.63.1
            - Allow zero second rolling/ordered deployment pauses. Make zero the default.
        
        0.63.0
        
            - Add ability to specify different delays between ordered gitdeploy batches and regular batches
            - Add deployment options to Deployment model object (useful for plugins)
            - Show deployment status in deployment list (GET /app/{appname}/deployments)
            - Fix server list in group detail (/app/{appname}/groups/{groupname}) when environment list is specified
