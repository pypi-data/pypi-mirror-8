Description: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Polyominoes enumerator
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The files of this repository allows one to enumerate polyominoes based on
        Jensen's algorithm. The code is written in Python, but it has been optimized
        using Cython.

        Dependencies

        - `GCC <http://gcc.gnu.org/>`__

        Python module dependencies

        =======
        Roadmap
        =======
        
        - Update the docstring in polyenum package (enumerators, data_structures
          modules).
        - Enhance --north-snake option implementation. The criterion for exluding
          invalid north snake candidate can be enhanced using the fact that for any
          row of a north snake the pattern ``x...0...x`` cannot be found. Since the
          algorithm builds polyominoes column after column, it would be a good idea to
          make all of the "left snakes" and rotate the results.
        - Creates a test suite.
        - Implements Knuth's algorithm for the minimum connectivity problem (see comment
          in source code). This will improve significantly the speed when enumerating
          polyominoes.
        - Takes into account symmetry to improve speed of algorithm. It will also allow
          to generate free/fixed/one-sided polyominoes. Currently, only fixed
          polyominoes are generated.
        - Add other types of installers (MacPorts, Homebrew, Windows, Debian package,
          ArchLinux). 
        - Add a script for extracting statistics and classifying.
        - Add a script for drawing.
        - Improve speed for enumerating partially directed snakes (it uses a Python
          boolean list instead of a bool*). Moreover, the enumeration columnwise could
          discard more configurations than by looking only at the pillars.
        
        =========
        Howto use
        =========
        
        The script ``polyenum`` is used to call the enumeration code. You can
        ``./scripts/polyenum --help`` for help.
        
        -------------------
        From git repository
        -------------------
        
        In order for the script to run properly, the Cython library has to be compiled.
        It's done by doing::
        
            $ ./configure
            $ make
        
        and then, ``polyenum`` will be available under ``./scripts`` directory.

        Example
        =======
        
        -----------------------------------------
        Enumerating all polyominoes of given area
        -----------------------------------------
        
        Let the area of the polyominoes be **4**. Finding all the polyominoes (not
        inscribed in a particular rectangle) of area 4 is done as follows::
        
            $ ./polyenum -a 4 --fixed
            Fixed polyomino enumeration.

        ==========
        Installing
        ==========
        
        ----------------------
        From PyPi dist release
        ----------------------
        
        Simply do::
        
            python2.7 setup.py install
        
        -------------------
        From git repository
        -------------------
        
        The script can be installed on your system. This is useful since it provides
        bash tab completion capability for the script. To install, simply do::
        
            $ ./configure
            $ make
            # make install
        
        **NOTE**: Most of the installation process is done by python. On some platforms,
        python may install scripts under a directory which is not in your $PATH bash
        environnement variable.
        
        ```````````````
        Bash Completion
        ```````````````
        
        In order to install bash completion, do the following ::
        
            $ BASH_COMPLETION_DIR=$p ./configure
            $ make
            # make install
        
        where ``$p`` is the path to the directory where bash-completion scripts are
        installed on your system.
