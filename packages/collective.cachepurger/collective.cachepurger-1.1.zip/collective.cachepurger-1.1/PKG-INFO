Description: collective.cachepurger
        ======================
        
        Cachepurger scraches a small itch. We've experienced that when we deploy a new 
        version of a Plone package, it does not behave as expected even though it did 
        at the test server. One reason is that the resource registries or caches contains 
        old data.
        
        Cachepurge simply empties the different Zope RAM caches and rebuilds CSS and 
        Javascript from the registries.
