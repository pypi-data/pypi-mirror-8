Building Large Applications
===========================

Introduction
------------

A small web application is relatively easy to understand. It does
less stuff. That makes the application easier to understand: the UI
(or REST web service) is smaller, and the codebase too.

But sometimes we need larger web applications. Morepath offers a
number of facilities to help you manage the complexity of larger web
applications:

* Morepath lets you build larger applications from multiple smaller
  ones. A CMS may for instance be composed of a document management
  application and a user management application. This is much like how
  you manage complexity in a codebase by decomposing it into smaller
  functions and classes.

* Morepath lets you factor out common, reusable functionality. In
  other words, Morepath helps you build *frameworks*, not just
  end-user applications. For instance, you may have multiple places in
  an application where you need to represent a large result-set in
  smaller batches (with previous/next), and they should share common
  code.

There is also the case of reusable *applications*. Larger applications
are often deployed multiple times. An open source CMS is a good
example: different organizations each have their own installation. Or
imagine a company with an application that it sells to its customers:
each customer can have its own special deployment.

Different deployments of an application have real differences as every
organization has different requirements. This means that you need to
be able to customize and extend the application to fit the purposes of
each particular deployment. As a result the application has to
take on framework-like properties. Morepath recognizes that there is a
large gray area between application and framework, and offers support
to build framework-like applications and application-like frameworks.

The document doc:`app_reuse` describes the basic facilities Morepath
offers for application reuse. The document
:doc:`organizing_your_project` describes how a single application
project can be organized, and we will follow its guidelines in this
document.

This document sketches out an example of a larger application that
consists of multiple sub-projects and sub-apps, and that needs
customization.

A Code Hosting Site
-------------------

Our example large application is a code hosting site along the lines
of Github or Bitbucket. This example is a sketch, not a complete
working application. We focus on the structure of the application as
opposed to the details of the UI.

Let's examine the URL structure of a code hosting site. Our hypothetical
code hosting site lives on ``example.com``::

  example.com

A user (or organization) has a URL directly under the root with the
user name or organization name included::

  example.com/faassen

Under this URL we can find repositories, using the project name
in the URL::

  example.com/faassen/myproject

We can interact with repository settings on this URL::

  example.com/faassen/myproject/settings

We also have a per-repository issue tracker::

  example.com/faassen/myproject/issues

And a per-repository wiki::

  example.com/faassen/myproject/wiki

Simplest approach
-----------------

The simplest approach to make this URL structure work is to implement all
paths in a single application, like this::

  from .model import Root, User, Repository, Settings, Issues, Wiki

  class app(morepath.App):
      pass

  @app.path(path='', model=Root)
  def get_root():
     ...

  @app.path(path='{user_name}', model=User)
  def get_user(user_name):
     ...

  @app.path(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}', model=Repository)
  def get_repository(user_name, repository_name):
     ...

We could try to implement settings, issues and wiki as views on
repository, but these are complicated pieces of functionality that
benefit from having sub-URLs (i.e. ``issues/12`` or
``...wiki/mypage``), so we model them using paths as well::

  @app.path(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/settings', model=Settings)
  def get_settings(user_name, repository_name):
     ...

  @app.path(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/issues', model=Issues)
  def get_issues(user_name, repository_name):
     ...

  @app.path(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/wiki', model=Wiki)
  def get_wiki(user_name, repository_name):
     ...

Let's also make path to an individual issue,
i.e. ``example.com/faassen/myproject/issues/12``::

  from .model import Issue

  @app.path(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/issues/{issue_id}', model=Issue)
  def get_issue(user, repository, issue_id):
      ...

Problems
--------

This approach works perfectly well, and it's often the right way to
start, but there are some problems with it:

* The URL patterns in the path are repetitive; for each sub-model
  under the repository we keep having to repeat
  '{user_name}/{repository_name}`.

* We may want to be able to test the wiki or issue tracker during
  development without having to worry about setting up the whole outer
  application.

* We may want to reuse the wiki application elsewhere, or in multiple
  places in the same larger application. But ``user_name`` and
  ``repository_name`` are now hardcoded in the way to get any sub-path
  into the wiki.

* We could have different teams developing the core app and the wiki
  (and issue tracker, etc). It would be nice to partition the code so
  that the wiki developers don't need to look at the core app code and
  vice versa.

* You may want the abilitity to swap in new implementations of a issue
  tracker or a wiki under the same paths, without having to change a lot
  of code.

We're going to show how Morepath can solve these problems by
partitioning a larger app into smaller ones, and mounting them. The
code to accomplish this is more involved than simply declaring all
paths under a single core app as we did before. If you feel more
comfortable doing that, by all means do so; you don't have these
problems. But if your application is successful and grows larger you
may encounter these problems, and Morepath is there to help.

We'll now show what changes you would make.

Multiple sub-apps
-----------------

Let's split up the larger app into multiple sub apps. How many
sub-apps do we need? We could go and partition things up into many
sub-applications, but that risks getting lost in another kind of
complexity. So let's start with three application:

* core app, everything up to repository, and including settings.

* issue tracker app.

* wiki sub app.

In code::

  class core_app(morepath.App):
      pass

  class issues_app(morepath.App):
      variables = ['issues_id']

  class wiki_app(morepath.App):
      variables = ['wiki_id']

Note that ``issues_app`` and ``wiki_app`` expect variables; we'll
learn more about this later.

We now can group our paths into three. First we have the core app,
which includes the repository and its settings::

  @core_app.path(path='', model=Root)
  def get_root():
     ...

  @core_app.path(path='{user_name}', model=User)
  def get_user(user_name):
     ...

  @core_app.path(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}', model=Repository)
  def get_repository(user_name, repository_name):
     ...

  @core_app.path(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/settings', model=Settings)
  def get_settings(user_name, repository_name):
     ...

Then we have the paths for our issue tracker::

  @issues_app.path(path='', model=Issues)
  def get_issues(issues_id):
     ...

  @issues_app.path(path='{issue_id}', model=Issue)
  def get_issue(issues_id, issue_id):
      ...

And the paths for our wiki::

  @wiki_app.path(path='', model=Wiki)
  def get_wiki(wiki_id):
     ...

We have drastically simplified the paths in ``issues_app`` and
``wiki_app``; we don't deal with ``user_name`` and ``repository_name``
anymore. Instead we get a ``issues_id`` and ``wiki_id``, but not from
the path. Where does they come from? They are specified by the
``variables`` argument for :class:`morepath.App` that we saw
earlier. Next we need to explore the :meth:`App.mount` directive
to see how they are actually obtained.

Mounting apps
-------------

Now that we have an independent ``issues_app`` and ``wiki_app``, we want
to be able to mount these under the right URLs under ``core_app``. We
do this using the mount directive::

  @core_app.mount(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/issues',
                  app=issues_app)
  def mount_issues(user_name, repository_name):
      return { 'issues_id': get_issues_id(user_name, repository_name) }

Let's look at what this does:

* ``@core_app.mount``: We mount something onto ``core_app``.

* ``app=issues_app``: We are mounting ``issues_app``.

* ``path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/issues'``: We are mounting it
  on that path. All sub-paths in the issue tracker app will fall under
  it.

* The ``mount_issues`` function takes the path variables ``user_name``
  and ``repository_name`` as arguments. It then returns a dictionary
  with the mount variables expected by ``issues_app``, in this case
  ``issues_id``. It does this by using ``get_issues_id``, which does
  some kind of database access in order to determine ``issues_id`` for
  ``user_name`` and ``repository_name``.

Mounting the wiki is very similar::

  @core_app.mount(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/wiki',
                  app=wiki_app)
  def mount_wiki(user_name, repository_name):
      return { 'wiki_id': get_wiki_id(user_name, repository_name) }

No more path repetition
-----------------------

We have solved the repetition of paths issue now; the issue tracker
and wiki can consist of many paths, but there is no more need to
repeat '{user_name}/{repository_name}' everywhere.

Testing in isolation
--------------------

To test the issue tracker by itself, we can run it as a separate WSGI
app.  To do this we first need to mount it by passing an ``issues_id``
to it::

  def run_issue_tracker():
      mounted = issues_app(issues_id=4)
      morepath.run(mounted)

Here we mount and run the ``issues_app`` with issue tracker id
``4``. We can hook the ``run_issue_tracker`` function up to a script
by using an entry point in ``setup.py`` as we've seen in
:doc:`organizing_your_project`.

Reusing an app
--------------

We can now reuse the issue tracker app in the sense that we can mount
it in different apps; all we need is a way to get ``issues_id``. But
what if we want to mount the issue tracker app in a separate project
altogether? To use it we would need to import it from our project that
also contains the core app and the wiki app, meaning that the new
project would need to depend on all of this code. That can hinder
reuse.

To make it more reusable across projects we can instead maintain the
code for the issue tracker app in a separate project, and the same for
the wiki app. The core app can then depend on the issue tracker and
wiki projects. Another app that also wants to have an issue tracker
can depend on the issue tracker project too.

To do this we'd split our code into three separate Python projects,
for instance:

* ``myproject.core``

* ``myproject.issues``

* ``myproject.wiki``

Each would be organized as described in
:doc:`organizing_your_project`.

``myproject.core`` would have an ``install_requires`` in its
``setup.py`` that depends on ``myproject.issues`` and
``myproject.wiki``. To get ``issues_app`` and ``wiki_app`` in order to
mount them in the core, we would simply import them (for instance in
``myproject.core.main``)::

  from myproject.issues.main import issues_app
  from myproject.wiki.main import wiki_app

Different teams
---------------

Now that we have separate projects for the core, issue tracker and
wiki, it becomes possible for a team to focus on the wiki without
having to worry about core or the issue tracker and vice versa.

This may in fact be of benefit even when you alone are working on all
three projects! When developing software it is important to free up
your brain so you only have to worry about one detail at the time:
this an important reason why we decomposition logic into functions and
classes. By decomposing the project into three independent ones, you
can temporarily forget about the core when you're working on the issue
tracker, letting you free up your brain.

Swapping in a new sub-app
-------------------------

Perhaps a different, better wiki implementation is developed. Let's
call it ``shiny_new_wiki_app``. Swapping in the new sub application
is easy: it's just a matter of changing the mount directive::

  @core_app.mount(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/wiki',
                  app=shiny_new_wiki_app)
  def mount_wiki(user_name, repository_name):
      return { 'wiki_id': get_wiki_id(user_name, repository_name) }

Customizing an app
------------------

Let's change gears and talk about customization now.

Imagine a scenario where a particular customer wants *exactly* core
app, really, it's perfect, but then ... wait for it ... they actually
need a minor tweak.

Let's say they want an extra view on ``Repository`` that shows some
important customer-specific metadata. This metadata is retrieved from
a customer-specific extra database, so we cannot just add it to core
app. Besides, this new view isn't useful to other customers.

What we need to do is create a new customer specific core app in a
separate project that is exactly like the original core app by
extending it, but with the one extra view added. Let's call the
project ``important_customer.core``. ``important_customer.core`` has
an ``install_requires`` in its ``setup.py`` that depends on
``myproject.core`` and also the customer database (which we imagine is
called ``customerdatabase``).

Now we can import ``core_app`` from it in
``important_customer.core``'s ``main.py`` module, and extend from it::

  from myproject.core.main import core_app

  class customer_app(core_app):
      pass

At this point ``customer_app`` behaves identically to
``core_app``. Now let's make our customization and add a new JSON view
to ``Repository``::

  from myproject.core.model import Repository
  # customer specific database
  from customerdatabase import query_metadata

  @customer_app.json(model=Repository, name='customer_metadata')
  def repository_customer_metadata(self, request):
      metadata = query_metadata(self.id) # use repository id to find it
      return {
        'special_marketing_info': medata.marketing_info,
        'internal_description': metadata.description
      }

You can now run ``customer_app`` and get the core app with exactly the
one tweak the customer wanted: a view with the extra metadata. The
``important_customer.core`` project depends on ``customerdatabase``,
but ``myproject.core`` remains unchanged.

We've now made exactly the tweak necessary without having to modify
our original project. The original project continues to work the same
way it always did.

Swapping in, for one customer
-----------------------------

Morepath lets you add any directive, not just views. It also lets you
*override* things in the applications you extend. What if we had a new
wiki like before, but we only want to upgrade one particular to it,
and leave the others with the original? Perhaps our important customer
needs *exactly* the wiki app mounted in core app, really, it's
perfect... but they actually need a minor tweak to the wiki too.

We'd tweak the wiki just as we would tweak the core app. We end up
with a ``tweaked_wiki_app``::

  from myproject.wiki.main import wiki_app

  class tweaked_wiki_app(wiki_app):
       pass

  # some kind of tweak
  @tweaked_wiki_app.json(model=WikiPage, name='extra_info')
  def page_extra_info(self, request):
      ...

We now want a new version of ``core_app`` just for this customer that
mounts ``tweaked_wiki_app`` instead of ``wiki_app``::

  class important_customer_app(core_app):
      pass

  @important_customer_app.mount(path='{user_name}/{repository_name}/wiki',
                                app=tweaked_wiki_app)
  def mount_wiki(user_name, repository_name):
      return { 'wiki_id': get_wiki_id(user_name, repository_name) }

The ``mount`` directive above overrides the one in the ``core_app``
that we're extending, because it uses the same ``path`` but mounts
``tweaked_wiki_app`` instead.

You can override any other directive (path, view, etc) the same way.

Framework apps
--------------

A ``morepath.App`` subclass does not need to be a full working web
application. Instead it can be a framework consisting of just a few
with only those paths, subpaths and views that we intend to be
reusable.

For views this works together well with Morepath's understanding of
inheritance. We could for instance have a base class
``Metadata``. Whenever any model subclasses from it, we want that
model to gain a ``metadata`` view that returns this metadata as JSON
data. Let's write some code for that::

  class framework(morepath.App):
      pass

  class Metadata(object):
      def __init__(self, d):
          self.d = d # metadata dictionary

      def get_metadata(self):
          return self.d

  @framework.json(model=Metadata, name='metadata')
  def metadata_view(self, request):
      return self.get_metadata()

We want to use this framework in our own application::

  class app(framework):
      pass

Let's have a model that subclasses from ``Metadata``::

  class Document(Metadata):
      ...

Let's put the model on a path::

  @app.path(path='documents/{id}', model=Document)
  def get_document(id):
      ...

Since ``app`` extends ``framework``, all documents published this way
have a ``metadata`` view automatically. Apps that don't extend
``framework`` won't have this behavior, of course.

As we mentioned before, there is a gray area between application and
framework; applications tend to gain attributes of a framework, and
larger frameworks start to look more like applications. Don't worry
too much about which is which, but enjoy the creative possibilities!

Note that Morepath itself is designed as an application
(:class:`morepath.App`) that your apps extend. This means you can
override parts of it (say, how links are generated) just like you
would override a framework app!  We did our best to make Morepath do
the right thing already, but if not, you *can* customize it.
