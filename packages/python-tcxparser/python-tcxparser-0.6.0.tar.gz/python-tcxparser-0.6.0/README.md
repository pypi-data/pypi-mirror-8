# python-tcxparser

python-tcxparser is a minimal parser for Garmin's TCX file format. It
is not in any way exhaustive. It extracts just enough data to allow me
to post data from my Garmin ForeRunner 410 watch to
[DailyMile's](http://dailymile.com) API.

Data extracted:
 - latitude & longitude of start point of workout
 - type of workout (running, walking, etc)
 - time of completion of workout (in ISO UTC)
 - distance of workout (in meters)
 - duration of workout (in seconds)
 - calories burned during workout (as estimated by device)
 - average, max and min heart rate during workout
 - average pace during workout

## Installation

    pip install python-tcxparser

## Usage
