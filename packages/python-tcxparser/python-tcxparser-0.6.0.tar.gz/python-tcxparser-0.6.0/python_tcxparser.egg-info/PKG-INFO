Description: # python-tcxparser
        
        python-tcxparser is a minimal parser for Garmin's TCX file format. It
        is not in any way exhaustive. It extracts just enough data to allow me
        to post data from my Garmin ForeRunner 410 watch to
        [DailyMile's](http://dailymile.com) API.
        
        Data extracted:
         - latitude & longitude of start point of workout
         - type of workout (running, walking, etc)
         - time of completion of workout (in ISO UTC)
         - distance of workout (in meters)
         - duration of workout (in seconds)
         - calories burned during workout (as estimated by device)
         - average, max and min heart rate during workout
         - average pace during workout
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install python-tcxparser
        
        ## Usage
        
            >>> import tcxparser
            >>> tcx = tcxparser.TCXParser('/home/vinod/Downloads/20121226-212953.tcx')
            >>> # Duration of workout in seconds
            ... tcx.duration
            1992.78
            >>> # latitude/longitude at start of workout
            ... tcx.latitude
            35.951880198
            >>> tcx.longitude
            -79.0931872185
            >>> tcx.activity_type
            'running'
            >>> # ISO UTC timestamp when workout completed
            ... tcx.completed_at
            '2012-12-26T22:03:05Z'
            >>> # distance of workout in meters
            ... tcx.distance
            4686.31103516
            >>> tcx.distance_units
            'meters'
