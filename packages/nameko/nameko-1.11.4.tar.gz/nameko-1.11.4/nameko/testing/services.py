def worker_factory(service_cls, **injections):
    """ Return an instance of ``service_cls`` with its injected dependencies
    replaced with Mock objects, or as given in ``injections``.

    **Usage**

    The following example service proxies calls to a "math" service via
    and ``rpc_proxy`` injection::

        from nameko.rpc import rpc_proxy, rpc

        class ConversionService(object):
            math = rpc_proxy("math_service")

            @rpc
            def inches_to_cm(self, inches):
                return self.math.multiply(inches, 2.54)

            @rpc
            def cm_to_inches(self, cms):
                return self.math.divide(cms, 2.54)

    Use the ``worker_factory`` to create an unhosted instance of
    ``ConversionService`` with its injections replaced by Mock objects::

        service = worker_factory(ConversionService)

    Nameko's entrypoints do not modify the service methods, so they can be
    called directly on an unhosted instance. The injection Mocks can be used
    as any other Mock object, so a complete unit test for Service may look
    like this::

        # create worker instance
        service = worker_factory(Service)

        # replace "math" service
        service.math.multiply.side_effect = lambda x, y: x * y
        service.math.divide.side_effect = lambda x, y: x / y

        # test inches_to_cm business logic
        assert service.inches_to_cm(300) == 762
        service.math.multiply.assert_called_once_with(300, 2.54)

        # test cms_to_inches business logic
        assert service.cms_to_inches(762) == 300
        service.math.divide.assert_called_once_with(762, 2.54)

    *Providing Injections*

    The ``**injections`` kwargs to ``worker_factory`` can be used to provide
    a replacement injection instead of a Mock. For example, to unit test a
    service against a real database:

    .. literalinclude:: examples/testing/unit_with_provided_injection_test.py
