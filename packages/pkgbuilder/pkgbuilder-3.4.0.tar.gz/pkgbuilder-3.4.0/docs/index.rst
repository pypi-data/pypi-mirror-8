PKGBUILDer is an AUR helper, i.e. an application which builds AUR
packages.  It can be used in conjunction with pacman (with a special
script).  It uses various techniques to automatize the process as
much as possible.

Since version 2.1.0, PKGBUILDer provides modules that can be used in
other scripts.

For standalone use, see the :doc:`PKGBUILDer man page <pkgbuilder>`.
Reading the :doc:`README <README>` is also a good idea.

For the PBWrapper (``pb``), see the :doc:`PBWrapper man page <pb>`.

For developers using PKGBUILDer as a Python module, see the respective class
documents.
