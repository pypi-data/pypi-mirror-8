Description: ========================================
        Custom egg upload where the user wants
        ========================================
        
        This package provides a plugin for ``zest.releaser`` that offers to upload the
        released egg via SCP, SFTP or HTTP(S) PUT (WebDAV) to a custom location (instead of or
        in addition to PyPI).
        
        This plugin is based on `gocept.zestreleaser.customupload`_ to do the upload process
        and uses the `distbase` and `distdefault` concept of `jarn.mkrelease`_, so you need to
        add something like this to your ``~/.pypirc`` like the following::
        
            [cs.zestreleaser.upload]
            _default_with_input_ = scp://download.gocept.com//var/www/customers/
            _default_ = scp://download.gocept.com//var/www/packages
        
        
        If the option ``_default_with_input`` is set, the script will ask the user a folder name
        that will be appended to the setting, and the created egg will be uploaded there and the
        script will finish there.
        
        This option is useful if you have a folder where you have one folder per project/customer
        in the same place.
        
        If the option ``_default_with_input`` is not set and ``_default_`` is set, the script will
        upload the egg to that destination. This is usefull as a default destination of your eggs.
        
        
        Options for HTTP(S) PUT (WebDAV)
        ================================
        
        This option is the same as in `gocept.zestreleaser.customupload`_ so
        HTTP(S) PUT (WebDAV) is implemented using `curl` to add options to `curl`,
        e. g. to disable certificate checks, add the options in front of the URL
        like this::
        
            [cs.zestreleaser.upload]
            gocept.special = --insecure https://dav.gocept.com/special
