Description: more.forwarded: Forwarded header support for Morepath
        =====================================================
        
        If you want to run Morepath_ behind a trusted proxy that sets the
        `Forwarded header`_, you can use ``more.forwarded`` to make Morepath
        generate URLs that take this header into account.
        
        **Note**: Only use this if you know you are behind a trusted proxy
        that indeed sets the Forwarded header, otherwise you expose your
        server to potential attacks.
