        The Enstaller (version 4) project is a package management and installation
        tool for egg-based Python distributions.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The preferred and easiest way to install Enstaller is from the executable egg,
        i.e. the Enstaller egg contains a bash header and on Unix systems you can
        download the egg and type::
        
           $ bash enstaller-4.6.1-1.egg

        Once Enstaller is installed, it can update itself.  Note that,
        as Enstaller is the install tool for the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD),
        all EPD installers already include Enstaller.
        
        Available features
        ==================
        
        Enstaller consists of the sub-packages enstaller (package management tool) and
        egginst (package (un)installation tool).
        
        enstaller
        ---------
        
        enstaller is a management tool for egginst-based installs. The CLI, called
        enpkg, calls out to egginst to do the actual installation. Enpkg is concerned
        with resolving dependencies, managing user configuration and fetching eggs
        reliably.
        
        egginst
        -------
        
        egginst is the underlying tool for installing and uninstalling eggs. It
        installs modules and packages directly into site-packages, i.e.  no .egg
        directories are created.
