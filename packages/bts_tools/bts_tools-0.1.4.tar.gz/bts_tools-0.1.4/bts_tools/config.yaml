# the logging levels for the different submodules

# list of clients that can be run
#
# clients define the following vars:
#  - type: the type of build you want to run. Needs to be a valid build env (ie: bts, dns, ...)
#  - debug: set to true to run client in gdb (only available in linux for now)
#  - data_dir: [optional] the data dir (blockchain, wallet, etc.) of the bts client.
#                         If not specified, uses the standard location of the client
#  - run_args: [optional] any additional flags you want to pass to the cmdline invocation of the client
#
# by default, if you don't specify a client on the cmdline, the tools will
# run the client using the 'bts' run environment
#
# Example:
#
# run_environments:
#     seed-bts:
#         type: bts
#         debug: false
#         run_args: ['--p2p-port', '1778', '--clear-peer-database']

wsgi_debug: false

# whether to profile how much time the RPC calls take to render
profile: false

# in the 'nodes' variable you should specify the list of instances of the bitshares client
# you intend to run on this computer.
# Nodes can be of 2 types:
#  - seed nodes
#  - delegate nodes
#
# The choice of node type will tune a bit the interface and enable/disable
# functionality, such as feed publishing for delegates but not for seed nodes
#
# Delegate nodes can either be on localhost, or on a different host. In that case,
# you need ssh access to the remote host where you also have the bts_tools
# installed in a virtualenv.
#
# For each node you can specify which type of monitoring you want:
#  - feeds: checks price feeds, and optionally publish them if the node is a delegate
#  - email: send an email notification when client crashes or loses network connections
#  - boxcar: send an iOS push notification to the Boxcar app when client crashes or loses network connections
#
# Examples configs:
# nodes:
#     -
#         # you must specify the run environment of the client
#         # this will fetch rpc connections params automatically
#         # NOTE: this needs to be a valid run environment!
#         client: bts
#         type: delegate   # delegate node type: run a single delegate account
#         name: delegate1  # the name of the delegate. This needs to be an existing account
#         monitoring: [feeds,email]
#     -
#         client: bts
#         type: seed    # seed node type: no need for open wallet, high number of connections
#         name: seed01  # the name for this seed node. This is just for you, it serves no other purpose
#         desired_number_of_connections: 200
#         maximum_number_of_connections: 400
#         # you can specify the rpc connection params. This will override the values
#         # from the data directory
#         rpc_port: 5678
#         rpc_user: username

#     -
#         client: bts
#         type: delegate   # remote delegate node type: access to a remote node's delegate info. You need to have ssh access to this node for this to work

#         venv_path: ~/.virtualenvs/bts_tools # virtualenv dir in which the bts tools are installed on the remote machine
