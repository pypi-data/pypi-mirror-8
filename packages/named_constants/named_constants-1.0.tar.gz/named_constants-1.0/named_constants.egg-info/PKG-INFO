Description: This module offers an easy way to define named constants in Python,
        supporting some simple enum-like use case, as well as arbitrary value
        types like strings or floats.  It is rather simple to use and does not
        have a big footprint, but supports the following features:
        
        * Ease of use (a simple class for scoping, plain definitions inside)
        * Enumeration of defined constants
        * Values know their *name*, i.e. you don't have to guess which meaning
          the constant value 3 has (e.g. it's name() will be 'blue' and its
          __repr__ will format as 'Colors.blue')
        * Arbitrary value types (not just integers)
        * Constant-ness (no change after time of definition)
