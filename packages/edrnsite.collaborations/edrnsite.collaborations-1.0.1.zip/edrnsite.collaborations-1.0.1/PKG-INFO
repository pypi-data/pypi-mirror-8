        ***********************
        
        This package, ``edrnsite.collaborations``, provides groupware capabilities
        (wiki, file space, calendars, etc.) for EDRN_ collaborative groups,
        implemented with Plone_.  Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can
        be installed into an Plone-compatible site.
        
        It was developed by the Informatics Center (IC_), operated by JPL_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.
        
        • Add ``edrnsite.collaborations`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
         
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                edrnsite.collaborations
                
        • Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
          
            % ./bin/buildout
                
        No need for a ZCML slug; we're using z3c.autoinclude.
