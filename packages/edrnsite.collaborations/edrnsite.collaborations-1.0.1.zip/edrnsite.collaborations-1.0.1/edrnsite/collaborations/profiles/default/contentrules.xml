A new item has been added to your group by ${user_fullname}.
     
The item is called "${title}".  You can view this newly-added item at the following URL:
     
${url}
     
Please note that if your mail reader wraps the URL across several lines, you may need to put it back together manually.  Also note that even though an item has been added, it may not be viewable to the general public or even logged-in users depending on the sharing permissions and publication state assigned to the item and the group in which it exists.

An item (such as a web page, an image, or other content) in your group had its publication state changed by ${user_fullname}.  Publication state refers to the publication workflow, and a change means it went from "private" to "pending review", or from "pending review" to "published", or from "published" to "retracted", and so forth.
     
The item that had its publication state changed is called "${title}". You can view the item at
     
${url}
     
Please note that if your mail reader wraps the URL across several lines, you may need to put it back together manually.  Also, depending on the new publication state (such as "private", for example), the item may not be viewable by the general public or even by logged-in users that lack appropriate sharing permissions to access it.
     
Thank you for taking the time to stay current on the dynamic changes happening in your group.</property>
