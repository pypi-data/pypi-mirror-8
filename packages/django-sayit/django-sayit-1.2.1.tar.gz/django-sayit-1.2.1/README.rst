SayIt
=====

SayIt is an open source Django application or project to store transcripts
and present them in a modern, searchable format.

One example of SayIt in action is mySociety's website
`sayit.mysociety.org <http://sayit.mysociety.org>`_ which contains a variety
of transcripts, including:

* `The Leveson Inquiry <http://leveson.sayit.mysociety.org>`_
* `The Charles Taylor trial <http://charles-taylor.sayit.mysociety.org>`_
* `The plays of Shakespeare <http://shakespeare.sayit.mysociety.org>`_

Another is `OpenHouse Nova Scotia <http://www.openhousens.ca>`_, providing an
unofficial record of the proceedings of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.

SayIt is a `Poplus component <http://poplus.org)>`_
by `mySociety <http://www.mysociety.org/>`_.
