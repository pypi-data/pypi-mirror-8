"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_Research_and_Innovation",,"Responsible Research and Innovation","Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) describes a research, development or innovation process that takes into account effects and potential impacts on the environment and society. It can be defined as ""a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society.""[1] The approach is and has been part of several European Framework Programmes and has been developed in scientific and technological publications in journals and conferences, as well as in projects. By June 2014, there were at least a dozen international research projects, most of them funded or co-funded by the European Commission, that were involved in developing a Responsible Research and Innovation governance framework.[2]

Apart from the well-known definition given in the first paragraph of this article, there are several other definitions of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI).

It ""refers to the comprehensive approach of proceeding in research and innovation in ways that allow all stakeholders that are involved in the processes of research and innovation at an early stage (A) to obtain relevant knowledge on the consequences of the outcomes of their actions and on the range of options open to them and (B) to effectively evaluate both outcomes and options in terms of societal needs and moral values and (C) to use these considerations (under A and B) as functional requirements for design and development of new research, products and services.""[3] The European Commission (EC) described RRI in an earlier publication as a framework that consisted of six key action points:[4]

According to Owen et al. (2012) there are three main features of RRI that overlap to a great extent with the EC Framework:[5]

According to Stilgoe et al. (2013), RRI has four dimensions:[6]

RRI is best understood as a higher level responsibility that aims to shape, develop, and align existing and future research and innovation-related processes.[7] The concept is applied mainly for science and technology-based research and innovation, in particular in the area of emerging technologies—notably nanotechnologies, Information and communications technology (ICT), genomics, synthetic biology and geo-engineering. However, some authors state that RRI could also encompass financial instruments, public policy or community innovations, distribution, service or system innovations.[8]

Responsible Research and Innovation is developed as an approach to governing research and innovation at the European Union level. It is ""reflected in many high-level policy, strategy and programming documents, such as the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy to create smart growth or the Horizon 2020 programme that defines tackling societal challenges as one of the main priorities.""[1]

The term RRI was coined in Europe and the United States in the first decade of the 21st century. Among the first authors who developed this concept from 2003 on were Hellstrom, Guston, Owen, and others (see the References section below).

At the European level the concept originates from visions for collaborations between social, natural and physical scientists that address the wider dimensions of science and innovation early on. Examples can be found within the 5th and 6th EU Framework Programmes and their calls for socio-technical integration.[9] More examples are calls for greater public engagement with science and technology.[10] According to Owen et al. (2012),[5] integrated approaches such as Technology assessment in its various forms, referring to publications from Schot and Rip (1996) and Guston and Sarewitz (2002), and anticipatory governance (see the paper by Karinen and Guston from 2010) are further roots of RRI. They claim that some of these features had been formalised within decision-making processes, such as the so-called ""Danish model"" for technology assessment based on public participation and deliberation, e.g. through consensus conferences (see [10]).

In the United States of America, many ideas that have shaped science policy emerged from the writings and influence of Vannevar Bush. Bush’s ""Science-The Endless Frontier"" (1945) proposed a civilian-led body to support research in the interest of meeting national goals. Bush attempted to design a system that pursued fundamental theoretical work and successfully connected it to application and societal needs.[11]

The European Commission stated in 2013 that because Responsible Research and Innovation was ""a cross-cutting action that is implemented throughout Horizon 2020, 0.5% of the budgets for the 'Societal Challenges' and 'Industrial Leadership' pillars of Horizon 2020 [was] earmarked for RRI/Science with and for Society actions.""[12] Innovation and new technologies should meet the global challenges such as climate change and global warming, the efficient use of natural resources, demographic change, global health and development, social cohesion and the maintenance of economic prosperity.[3]

It has been suggested that ""Grand Challenges""—tightening supplies of energy, water and food; pandemics; ageing societies; global warming; public health and security[13]—could be useful as a guiding force for RRI, in particular with regards to the criterion of societal desirability.[1] Another possible foundation for societal desirability with democratic legitimacy could be constitutional values.[14] Constitutional values of the European Union are ""respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Moreover, the societies of the Member States are characterised by pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men.""[15] Other values that play an important role in this context are the UN Global Compact's ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption.[16] Some member states of the European Union have the ambition to establish their own framework for RRI, so that national criteria and approaches are being developed and implemented. Here are some examples of these national initiatives and their funding in 2008:[8]

Even though Responsible Research and Innovation draws on the body of knowledge and experience provided by the history of Technology assessment over decades and on the methodological toolbox, it extends the scope of consideration to ethical issues of responsibility and to broader governance and science, technology and society (STS) issues.[17]

The main difference between Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and RRI is that the CSR approach tends to be industry-driven or rather ""an expression of corporate strategy, corporate identity, market power"".[18] CSR decisions are driven by the values of stakeholders by asking ""What do stakeholders care about?"". In contrast to that RRI establishes procedures to better integrate societal needs in the process of research and innovation and its methodology is centered on the equal roles and responsibility of societal actors and innovators.

Furthermore, CSR is mostly concerned with ethical acceptability (or legal responsibilities of human rights instruments) and sustainability (e.g. reducing pollution), not with societal desirability. This is illustrated by the United Nations Global Compact, a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles, which are concerning human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption.[19]

The principle of Creating Shared Value (CSV) starts where the UN Global Compact stops, namely how businesses can pursue social goals as part of their licence to operate. As such there is an overlap with RRI and its focus on societal desirability. However, the goal of CSV is to improve the competitiveness and economic profit of a company by addressing societal issues, whereas RRI ensures that science and innovation are ethically acceptable, sustainable and focused on societal benefits for society as a whole.

The term Corporate sustainability (also “sustainability” and “sustainable development”) communicates a company’s ambition to align its actions with the major social, environmental and economic changes that face society at large–and to prepare itself for the society of the future. However, it is about business in general and not specifically about Research and Innovation, has unidirectional top-down character and is not associated with collective responsibility, and civil society's engagement.",

 The situation 

 There is increasing scrutiny (and pressure) to explore ways of managing the development of new technologies with a view to both environmental and health risks as well as more broad societal effects. Moreover, there is pressure to do so at all stages of the innovation process (pressure of responsible research in laboratories, manufacturing legislature on nanoparticles, corporate social responsibility in industry etc.)

 

 With current explorations of means of achieving a responsible approach to nanotechnology (EU Action Plan & EU Open Consultation), principles for the oversight of nanotechnology 2007 (Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and others) and codes of conduct (European Nanotechnology Trade Alliance, Du Pont, the Nano Industries Association and others) it is time to take stock and look deeper into the notion of responsible research and development along the innovation chain. 

 

 The objective of this meeting is to explore and develop possible elements of a ""Best Nano Practice"" at each stage of the innovation chain (from laboratory to society) in anticipation of the increased emphasis on Responsible Research and Innovation. This increased emphasis can be seen in government funding programmes, the move towards corporate and social responsibility and pressures from other non-governmental actors such as NGOs and re-insurance groups. 

 

 The workshop will be divide in two parts, the former focussing on articulating what are key elements in a ""Best Nano Practice"" exploring issues of technology research, development and embedment into society. The second part will focus on suggestions of implementation and attribution of such nano practices in research, corporate sphere and in more formal regulation processes.

 

 The format will take the form of a 1-day workshop augmented by pre-circulated case studies and scenarios and will draw on representatives from research, industry, regulatory bodies, trade union representatives and NGOs to explore and develop suggestions for, and implementation of, a ""Best Nano Practice"".

The term “Responsible Research and Innovation” puts a lot of focus on the individual who is (or isn’t) responsible, their motivation, how their behaviour might be changed and the pressures on them to behave in ways that are not morally ideal.

CCSR has a strong track record of working on Responsible Research and Innovation. From the outset it has been centrally concerned with professionalism, with involvement in the development of professional codes (and awareness of the limitations of them). The research on eVoting which has since expanded into a theme that includes eGovernment would, at the time, have been classified as being within this strand, for good reason.

This thematic area concentrates on ICT artefacts and application areas that either have been developed or are very close to application. As such, there is a grey area between this area and the ‘Emerging Technologies’ thematic area (and presumably as technologies come towards widespread application they become less relevant to that thematic area and more relevant to this). Other thematic areas can also be expected to cover topics that could equally be covered in the Responsible Research and Innovation thematic area. There will thus need to be awareness and cooperation to avoid duplication of effort and ‘treading on toes’.

"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-987_en.htm",,"Eurobarometer Responsible Research and Innovation, Science and Technology","Why has this Eurobarometer been conducted? This Eurobarometer was funded by the Science and Society programme of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7).1 It offers valuable insight into public opinion and is part of the wider effort by the European Commission to better engage citizens with science, research and innovation and promote responsible research and innovation. Following up to this Eurobarometer, a new activity will be launched in the coming months under the Science in Society Programme, using the Eurobarometer research infrastructure to conduct pan-European focus group research with citizens and stakeholders. These activities identify the expectations of citizens and stakeholders with regard to science, technology and innovation, which will help the Commission to shape policies and set priorities for research and innovation programmes. How do citizens perceive science and technology? Consistent with findings of earlier Eurobarometer surveys2, this Eurobarometer confirms that there is no rejection of the impetus towards innovation: the vast majority of Europeans have a positive view on science and technology. The 2013 Eurobarometer ‘Responsible Research and Innovation’ shows that 77% of EU citizens agree that science and technology have a positive impact on society, and the majority of respondents in each country think this way. There is however concern about their potential for negative consequences, and the speed of change they can cause on our ways of life. Furthermore, more than half of Europeans believe that when it comes to decisions made about science and technology, public dialogue is required (55%). This is also consistent with previous Eurobarometer surveys4, which indicate that public dialogue is especially desired when social values are at stake.3 The 2013 RRI Eurobarometer furthermore shows that at least half of all Europeans are interested in developments in science and technology (53%), although only 40% say they feel informed about them. Country level results illustrate that levels of information about developments in science and technology are not uniform, with Eastern and Southern countries less likely to feel informed: There is a strong positive correlation (r=0.74) between being informed about developments in science and technology and the level of innovation performance at national level. However, there is not a strong correlation between feeling informed about developments in science and technology and thinking that the influence of science on society is positive. Societal opinion on science and innovation is therefore not principally determined by ‘science literacy’. Other interesting findings are that eight out of ten respondents agree that the EU should actively promote worldwide respect for European ethical principles for conducting scientific research. Also, more than eight out of ten (86%) respondents think it is important that scientific research takes equal account of the needs of men and women. How do citizens perceive the actors involved in science and technology? University or government scientists (82%) and environmental protection associations (81%) are most likely to be seen as trying to behave responsibly towards society when it comes to decisions about science and technology. University or government scientists (66%) are also most likely to be seen as best qualified to explain the impact of scientific and technological developments on society, with scientists in private laboratories ranking second (35%). Government representatives are the least likely to be seen as trying to behave responsibly in this area (44%) and they are also very unlikely to be seen as best qualified to explain the impact of scientific and technological developments on society (6%). Socio-demographic analysis shows that there is a positive correlation between being more familiar with science and technology (in terms of education, interest, informed, family member in science) and being more likely to think for each group that it tries to behave responsibly towards society. No notable differences are found in opinion between men and women and there are also relatively few differences between age groups: How are citizens informed about science and technology? Overall just under half of all Europeans (47%) have studied science or technology. Furthermore, while 53 % of Europeans are interested in developments in science and technology, only 40% say they feel informed about them. There is therefore a need to support both formal and informal science education, especially in Southern and Eastern EU Member States where levels of feeling informed are relatively low. The survey shows that there is broad support for science education: most Europeans think that their government is doing too little to stimulate young people’s interest in science (65%). A majority also agree that an interest in science improves young people’s job prospects (59%), culture (72%), and their ability to act as well-informed citizens (68%). Television is the most mentioned source of information about developments in science and technology (65%), followed by the internet (35%) and newspapers (33%). What other activities will the European Commission support in this area? Following up to the various actions funded through the FP7 'Science in Society' programme, the Commission will continue to promote public engagement and responsible research and innovation, in particular via the next framework programme for research and innovation: Horizon 2020.4 Horizon 2020 has a strong orientation towards addressing the societal challenges faced by Europe and the World and actively seeks the input from stakeholders and citizens. Public engagement and 'Responsible research and Innovation (RRI)' are cross-cutting actions throughout Horizon 2020, furthermore supported by the 'Science with and for Society' objective that has been allocated a budget of 462 Million Euro.5 Also, representatives from civil society will be involved in Horizon 2020 External Advisory Boards and in the monitoring and evaluation of Horizon 2020 activities. As a concrete example of this drive to broaden and widen participation in Horizon 2020, the recent VOICES project aims to involve European citizens in the definition of research priorities in the area of urban waste.6 It was launched in 2013 under the 'Science in Society' programme of the 7th Framework Programme. Some 99 citizen panel discussions, involving a total of 990 citizens in all European countries, have been held and have provided ideas and expectations. The results of the consultation have been fed into the development of the Work Programme for the Societal Challenge 'Climate Action, Environment, Resource Efficiency and Raw Materials' of Horizon 2020.",

"http://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Responsible_Research_and_Innovation",,"Documents in Responsible Research and Innovation - Academia.edu","Social entrepreneurs can be seen as the ‘transformational leaders’ who combine entrepreneurship with a societal vision while building bridges between business, governments and citizens (Purdue, 2001). But how do they take up this role and act as change agents for societal transitions? It is their innovation which is essential for realizing these transitions. The emerging concept of ‘Responsible Research & Innovation’ (RRI), as a transformative and constructive approach (Owen et al., 2013), can help to understand how social entrepreneurs actually stimulate and shape these transitions, since it combines social and economic goals. RRI is a transparent, interactive process where involved actors become mutually responsive to each other, aiming for the innovation process and its marketable products being adopted by society (von Schomberg, 2011). 

 

Although, RRI has the potential to understand the transformational leadership of social entrepreneurship. The problem is that the field of corporate innovation is underexposed in current RRI research (cf. Blok, 2013). This raises the question: how in fact is RRI embedded in the innovation practices of social enterprises? 

In the literature, various reasons are identified why SMEs can have a predisposition for engaging in responsible innovation (Rodgers, 2010 in Halme & Korpela, 2013; Scholten et al., 2013). It is for instance assumed that they are to be more adaptive and responsive to society than (larger) firms or incumbents (Scholten et al., 2013).  However, it is still the question how exactly SMEs engage in RRI in practice and how they contribute to societal transitions. 

 

Social enterprises are an interesting subgroup of SMEs, and the units of analysis in this paper, because the goal to create social value through social innovations show resemblance with the goals of RRI (viz. a social, environmental and economic positive impact). Furthermore, in order to take care for the future, RRI should be for society and with society through responsive stewardship in the present (Stilgoe et al., 2013). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to answer the question: to what extent do social enterprises take responsibility into account in their innovation processes? 

 

To answer this question, we will do a content analyses on approximately 150 cases of social enterprises linked with climate change adaptation and mitigation in urban areas. The data will be obtained from the ope n database of Ashoka (largest network of social entrepreneurs worldwide). Their platform shares elaborate case descriptions of social enterprises with regard to: the problem that the social enterprises address, the ideas that they have, the strategies to solve to problem and personal information about the social entrepreneurs. These social entrepreneurs provide information via a five step process with regard to: newness, creativity, entrepreneurial quality, social impact and ethical fibre. 

 

In order to do such a content analysis, we will first develop a theoretical framework with all the relevant elements of industrial RRI processes, based on a review of the RRI literature (e.g. goals, ethics, stakeholder involvement, technology assessment). Subsequently, we will code the case descriptions based on the operationalized indicators, which implies a deductive content analysis. Finally, we will assess to what extent the individual indicators of responsible innovation are addressed by social enterprises. Because most current work on (industrial) RRI is still conceptual or based on single case studies, this research aims to fill the knowledge gap in RRI literature with more empirical results.",

How do we know it when we see it? What does irresponsible research and innovation look like? My response is perhaps a bit unsatisfying. RRI is a work-in-progress, as are science, politics and society more broadly. This means that RRI is necessarily experimental and open-ended. Responsible science and responsible technologies will not just show themselves. But we can look at experiments that are taking place at various levels in various places, to see how the rules of research and innovation may be rewritten in more responsible ways. Here is my starting list of 13 RRI things I have found interesting. This is not to say that all of these things are unequivocally good. An important part of RRI is the surfacing of differences and political clashes around all of these things. But they seem to me to be interesting developments.

This list is inspired by a project in which I and colleagues at UCL are involved, called RRI TOOLS. It aims to develop a toolkit for responsible research and innovation that can be taken up by scientists, policymakers, companies and others. The inevitable imperfection with such a project is that it will tend to emphasise processes rather than outcomes. This is why, as with the SPICE project, the Polio Vaccine, Pugwash and the Bermuda Principles, we should also pay attention to situations in which people have responsibility thrust upon them. Systems of research and innovation are as likely to be responsibly shaped by accidents as by intentional efforts to increase public engagement and force disciplines to work together.

The concept has begun to move beyond the academic literature to become an integrated requirement of Centres for Doctoral Training and Synthetic Biology Centres funded by EPSRC and BBSRC. As RRI has become exposed to a broader range of actors, so the potential for different interpretations of the concept increases.

This seminar investigates how RRI is being interpreted within one research-intensive Russell Group university, and the opportunities and challenges for governance. Using documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews, we identify six key narratives that express actors’ perceptions of RRI’s purpose and value. We present a conceptual framework based upon these narratives, and argue that future moves to broaden or narrow RRI’s definition will likely result in material effects on actors’ support for the agenda within the university.

Responsible Research and Innovation is defined and operationalized in various ways. Owen, Macnaghten and Stilgoe (2013) define it as 'collective commitment of care for the future through responsive stewardship of science and innovation in the present', more specifically that innovation should be: a) Anticipatory; b) Reflective; c) Deliberative; and d) Responsive. Others add that science and innovation need to realise 'right impacts' or contribute to solving societal goals (von Schomberg 2013).

Responsibility is an agent-centred term and in this presentation Dr Forsberg will address the issue of who has responsibility for ensuring that research and innovation is indeed responsible. Researchers and research funders have so far been the most targeted agents for RRI, but other agents may also have a large influence on how research and innovation impacts on society and the natural world. This includes regulators, advisory bodies, industry organisations and market-shaping actors. How can their responsibilities be articulated in an RRI perspective?",

Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) aims to bring together researchers, citizens, policy makers, businesses and educators to cooperate during the entire research and innovation process in order to align the outcomes of research with the values and needs of society.

RRI is a cross-cutting issue in the European Commission ‘Horizon 2020’ Framework Programme. Its ultimate ambition is to address the great challenges of our time (climate change, energy, health, etc.) and to encourage smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe. It is still an emerging concept and, in order to implement RRI, concrete tools are needed. This is where our project steps in.

RRI Tools is a project funded for three years (2014-2016) by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (FP7). A 26 members’ Consortium has been set up, extending across 30 countries in the European Research Area.

This project aims to develop a Toolkit to help in the implementation of Responsible Research and Innovation in Europe. Collaborating with all stakeholders, it will help create a Community of Practice in Europe, which will ensure the use, evolution and enrichment of the Toolkit. In order to build this Community of Practice, the Consortium relies on 19 national centres, the RRI Hubs, responsible for opening participation to the maximum number of institutions and individuals in the field.The project is divided into three phases and is based on a permanent dialogue with all the stakeholders.

A Comparison of Two Criteria for Funding Research in Science and Engineering","Our subject is how the experience of Americans with a certain funding criterion, “broader impacts” (and some similar criteria) may help in efforts to turn the European concept of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) into a useful guide to funding Europe’s scientific and technical research. We believe this comparison may also be as enlightening for Americans concerned with revising research policy. We have organized our report around René Von Schomberg’s definition of RRI, since it seems both to cover what the European research group to which we belong is interested in and to be the only widely accepted definition of RRI. According to Von Schomberg, RRI: “… is a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society).” While RRI seeks fundamental changes in the way research is conducted, Broader Impacts is more concerned with more peripheral aspects of research: widening participation of disadvantaged groups, recruiting the next generation of scientists, increasing the speed with which results are used, and so on. Nevertheless, an examination of the broadening of funding criteria over the last four decades suggests that National Science Foundation has been moving in the direction of RRI.",

How do we know it when we see it? What does irresponsible research and innovation look like? My response is perhaps a bit unsatisfying. RRI is a work-in-progress, as are science, politics and society more broadly. This means that RRI is necessarily experimental and open-ended. Responsible science and responsible technologies will not just show themselves. But we can look at experiments that are taking place at various levels in various places, to see how the rules of research and innovation may be rewritten in more responsible ways. Here is my starting list of 13 RRI things I have found interesting. This is not to say that all of these things are unequivocally good. An important part of RRI is the surfacing of differences and political clashes around all of these things. But they seem to me to be interesting developments.

This list is inspired by a project in which I and colleagues at UCL are involved, called RRI TOOLS. It aims to develop a toolkit for responsible research and innovation that can be taken up by scientists, policymakers, companies and others. The inevitable imperfection with such a project is that it will tend to emphasise processes rather than outcomes. This is why, as with the SPICE project, the Polio Vaccine, Pugwash and the Bermuda Principles, we should also pay attention to situations in which people have responsibility thrust upon them. Systems of research and innovation are as likely to be responsibly shaped by accidents as by intentional efforts to increase public engagement and force disciplines to work together.

"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ejis/journal/v21/n3/full/ejis201219a.html",,"Responsible research and innovation in information systems","The field of information systems (IS) is characterised by a plurality of positions and approaches that defy simple definitions or characterisations. One aspect that I believe many, if not most, IS scholars can agree on is that IS research aims to describe and understand the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in order to lead to better societal and organisational practices and outcomes. If this hypothesis is correct, then it raises a number of follow-on questions. How can we know what constitutes ‘better’ rather than ‘worse’ or, as a condition of answering this question: Can we agree on a shared view of what counts as ‘good’ in IS?

This is a difficult question which points to an extended history of discussing normative issues, that is, issues of ethics and morality, law and customs, prescriptions and proscriptions. This discourse has pervaded the IS literature from its inception. Questions of implicit and explicit norms concerning the use of information technology can be traced back to Norbert Wiener (1954). They have been discussed ever since (Bynum, 2008). They are reflected in attempts to professionalise the work of ICT and IS specialists as reflected in codes of conduct or codes of ethics by professional bodies, which can again be traced back to the 1950s. In the field of IS, there has been a steady stream of research and publications on normative issues (Mason, 1986; Culnan & Williams, 2009) which has more recently led to more attention to ethics as a specific focus of IS research (Bryant et al, 2009; Mingers & Walsham, 2010) and IS education (Harris et al, 2011), as well as the role of ethics in particular aspects or approaches to IS (Myers & Klein, 2011; Stahl, 2008).

The purpose of this editorial is not to engage in these substantive discussions. By highlighting the shared concern about normative issues and their history in IS, I have tried to point to the importance of thinking about questions of responsibility in IS. I would like to propose that collectively and individually the field of IS and the researchers and practitioners working within it have an important role to play in ensuring that socio-technical innovations have beneficial consequences. In this editorial, I will lay out what sort of normative challenges the field of IS needs to address and why it is uniquely suited to do so. By looking at the way in which other fields or disciplines currently address such issues, I will return to the question how this can be done in IS and which conditions need to be fulfilled in order for IS to be researched, developed and deployed in a responsible manner.

Top A look at any newspaper on an average day will show that there are numerous news items related to normative aspects of ICT. There are husbands who spy on wives using social networks, hackers defrauding bank customers, paedophiles exchanging pictures of child sexual abuse and many others. These problems are not confined to individual misuse of technology, but cover more fundamental and larger scale discussions. In the U.K., for example, there were the debates about electronic patient records in the National Health Service, the national DNA database or the national Identification Card scheme. There are international concerns about privacy protection of the users of social networks, ownership of the content of large databases and the role of the state in regulating or facilitating the use of networks. Each of these examples continues to sustain regional, national and even international debates. These often lead to legislation and regulation, which, in turn, raise further debate. A good example of this at the time of writing the present editorial (February 2012) is the European Union's postulation of a ‘right to be forgotten’, currently proposed by Viviane Reding, European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship and Vice-President of the European Commission. These debates are general societal debates of issues that have the potential to affect almost any member of society. Members of the IS field are therefore potential contributors to such debates in their role as members of society. I would like to argue, however, that our knowledge and experience allow us to take a more pronounced stance and, arguably, oblige us to become more visible and offer our expertise to public debates with a broad range of stakeholders, including especially policymakers. The reason for this is that the normative problems outlined above are intrinsically linked to the interplay between technology, individuals and organisations. IS has a long history of researching such issues and therefore a repertoire of methods, approaches and theories that are uniquely suited to shed light on them. To put it differently, IS scholars are in a position to be responsive to other stakeholders, improve understanding of socio-technical capabilities and affordances and explain the history and development path of current IS. This specialised knowledge is important for our societies to choose options that are deemed desirable. At the moment, public debates and resulting societal engagement are much less visible in the IS field than they are in other fields of research and innovation, such as nanotechnology or synthetic biology. It is an interesting question to speculate why this is so. It may well be that ICT is now so widely spread that people often fail to realise its potential to do good or harm. Furthermore ICT, at least in the form of currently available products for the consumer and corporate markets, does not pose fundamental questions about the nature of reality and humanity as the other fields may do. My guess is that this will change. Recent research, for example, in the European Union 7th Framework Programme's research project ETICA (Ethical Issues of Emerging ICT Applications http://www.etica-project.eu, (I served as coordinator of this project)) suggests that emerging ICTs will raise a host of novel ethical issues. In addition to an exacerbation of existing problems such as privacy or intellectual property, novel and emerging information technologies are likely to raise issues that are currently less widely discussed. There are numerous technologies, such as brain–computer interfaces, neuro–computing or human–machine symbiosis that shed doubt on the traditional distinction between humans and technology. They have the potential to significantly alter the way we individually and collectively view ourselves. New developments in robotics, ambient intelligence, affective computing or the future Internet may change the way we organise fundamental social processes, from leisure to political participation. These technologies are about to raise questions that will need to be answered and the IS field can make important contributions to this.

Top The concept of RRI is gaining currency in different disciplines. It represents the attempt to provide an answer to the multitude of ethical, moral, legal and other problems arising from the use of technology research and innovation (Von Schomberg, 2011). In addition to technical developments, there are other factors, which render traditional ways of dealing with such issues problematic. On the one hand there is the ever-increasing pace of research and development, which can often lead to technical systems or applications being widely distributed throughout society before any serious thought can be given to their relevance and consequences. These developments furthermore happen on a global scale, rendering them difficult to observe and even more difficult to regulate. This is mirrored by the fragmentation of social authority which leaves existing governance models problematic (Zhang et al, 2011). There have been attempts to proactively address the normative side of technical developments. The probably most notable example of this, at least in Europe, is the attempt to establish mechanisms of RRI in nanotechnology, as represented by the European Commission's (2008) code of conduct for nanotechnology. Further examples come from the fields of synthetic biology (Gutmann, 2011) and, currently debated in the U.K., responsibility in geo-engineering (Macnaghten & Owen, 2011). What these activities have in common is that they represent attempts to deal with the uncertain, global and fragmented nature of research and innovation. They incorporate aspects of technology foresight with an awareness of the necessity to engage in broader social discussions. Responsibility, etymologically a term referring to communication, requires the ability and willingness to communicate. Different stakeholders need to be engaged and meaningful communications need to be held that have manifest and relevant consequences. This will lead to the definition or reconsideration of novel or established responsibilities. RRI is likely to require a tight network of interlinking and mutually dependent responsibilities. The rest of this editorial is going to concentrate on two aspects of RRI: (1) what are the conditions, principles and possible implementations of the idea and (2) what is the role that the IS community can play in it?

Top In order for RRI to play a significant role in research and development in general and in the area of IS in particular, several conditions need to be met. Some of these refer to higher-level activities in the area of research and industry policy. These include the requirement to develop legal or other regulatory systems that incentivise researchers, industry and organisations to engage with normative questions. In addition, there is a need for support mechanisms that will allow individuals and organisations who deal with this sort of question to find out about current norms and regulations, as well as good practice and successful solutions. In order for such policy development to be relevant and successful, it will need to incorporate the viewpoints and positions of it broad range of stakeholders. Such higher level policy and societal arrangement should then lead to the recognition that responsible ways of addressing ethical issues are in the interest of the researchers and organisations who realise innovation. The engagement with ethical questions will require the development of reflective processes within research, so that norms, their context and application can be understood, predicted and influenced. It is currently not yet clear in detail how these requirements can be met and what needs to be done in order to render them relevant in daily practice. One way of implementing the first item, the need to incentivise the IS and ICT research communities, may be to establish a more broadly accepted approach to an ethical impact assessment (Wright, 2011). A suggestion that may point the way for an appropriate solution to the second question, the guidance and good practice, is what we have termed the Observatory for RRI. A first prototype of this observatory is currently being constructed in context of the U.K. research project ‘Framework for Responsible Research and Innovation in ICT’ (http://www.responsible-innovation.org.uk). These developments will require the collaboration of a broad range of organisations and individuals with different experiences and backgrounds. As indicated, earlier, I believe that the IS community is in a unique position to contribute to these developments.

Top The role of the IS community There are several reasons why individual IS scholars and the IS community as a whole can and should contribute to these debates around RRI. The first one is the breadth of experience and knowledge that IS as an academic field has developed during the last 40–50 years. Theories, methodologies and approaches to understanding and influencing their relationship between information technology, organisations and society have been well developed in the IS. The interdisciplinary nature of the field allows its members to easily communicate with members of other fields. One driving force behind the entire debate concerning RRI is the recognition that in modern societies technology and its development can no longer be left to technical experts, but needs to be scrutinised, understood and accompanied by society at large. While it is open to debate how this can be achieved in detail, it is quite clear that participative technology assessment (van Eijndhoven & van Est, 2002) and development will need to play a significant role in this process. There is a richness of knowledge and experience of participation in technology development built up over decades (Mumford & Henshall, 1978) that the IS field could use to contribute to the broader societal debate about technology. IS researchers and practitioners could thus be sought-after contributors to these debates. In addition to this they would also benefit in many respects by being involved in these current discussions. One can argue that, due to the changes of the nature and use of technologies, the focus of IS research should move from organisational and commercial environments towards a broader societal engagement. Web 2.0, social networks, ubiquitous mobile computing and so on require a broader outlook by IS researchers (Baskerville, 2011). Instead of just observing these technical and social developments, the IS community has the unique opportunity to participate in shaping them. By making their expertise available to stakeholders and policymakers, the IS community could fulfil its broader social responsibilities and help achieve what arguably should be its core mission: to improve our individual and collective lives by making the best possible use of available technologies.

Top In this issue of EJIS… We introduce very diverse articles concerning cutting edge technologies (online gaming, RFID) new concepts and related empirical works (legitimation, ECM, 3C's and IS architecture). This issue will also stimulate IS studies in areas like technology non-assimilation and technology addiction such as that witnessed among adolescent online game players. Both the first and last articles explore their proposed models in China. In the first article, ‘A case study of the legitimation process undertaken to gain support for an information system in a Chinese university’, the researchers: Donal Flynn from University of Manchester and Yongqin Du a business analyst at Shell's IT Application Development & Projects division explore the Legitimation Acceptance Model (LAM) and its associated activities and strategies through an in-depth case study analysis focused on the introduction of a multi-function smartcard at a Chinese University. The research findings set forth previously unexplored LAM activities and strategies associated with the three legitimation processes (gaining, maintaining and repairing legitimation). In addition, the research points out to the dynamic nature of the LAM, which has been approached in a static view in most researches so far. The article's main contribution is therefore a finer comprehension of the LAM dynamic framework that underlies IS implementation, diffusion and adoption. In the second article, ‘Negotiating language barriers – a methodology for cross-organisational conceptual modelling’, the authors Gunnar Dietz and Martin Juhrisch from Dresden University of Technology introduce a generic algorithm for meta business modelling called the Description Kit Approach that promises to overcome domain conflicts. The domain conflicts typically arise from different language concepts, divergent cultural backgrounds and different levels of technical developments. Thus, such conflicts prohibit transposing the use of the conceptual models to other domains and gaining on modelling automation and cross-organisational comparisons. To resolve this problem, the researchers suggest a middle-modelling layer that introduces guidelines as mediators between language definitions and uses. The suggested algorithm is clarified through rich examples and although it imposes a preliminary codifying effort for the guidelines middle layer, it promises more flexible and adaptive modelling concepts and expanded uses for inter-organisational, outsourcing and multiple business contexts. Such meta modelling is particularly relevant in the IS area. Narges Kasiri from SUNY Oneonta, Ramesh Sharda from Oklahoma State University and Bill Hardgrave from Auburn University introduce in the third article, ‘A balanced scorecard for item-level RFID in the retail sector: a Delphi study’. This study benefited from the contribution of 12 experts and consultants from various backgrounds to the formulation of a retail's RFID balanced scorecard. It established a ready-to-use RFID balanced scorecard for managers. The consensus reached by these experts on the balanced scorecard measures, but also their divergent viewpoints that are revealed through this Delphi study, show which aspects and/or measures of RFID at item level need to be emphasised and are rendered important in particular situations. Last but not least, this study has the uniqueness of adopting item level RFID balanced scorecard measures across different retail perspectives: marketing, merchandising and supply chain (store execution). A variety of perspectives is a cornerstone for their model and was rare to find in a single study so far. In the fourth article, ‘Reviewing Enterprise Content Management: a functional framework’, the five authors Knut R. Grahlmann from Ernest & Young Advisory in the Netherlands; Remko W. Helms from Utrecht University; Cokky Hilhorst from Tilburg University; Sjaak Brinkkemper from Tilburg University; and Sander van Amerongen from PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory in the Netherlands research the literature on a clear definition and scope of what is exactly meant by Enterprise Content Management (ECM). Because of the literature inconsistencies, they perform a meta-literature review and propose a comprehensive definition of ECM that could be useful for future IS studies. They also point out why ECM should not be considered as an under discipline of knowledge management, but rather an adjacent field on its own and finally they propose a functional ECM framework (FEF) that could be used by practitioners to assess their ECMs and take future ECM investment decisions. The methodology consists in investigating in three organisations, their proposed framework by following up on ECM functionalities. The interest of the article is that their work brings closer the views of IS scholars and those of IS practitioners. It is pragmatic in the sense that they suggest a ready-to-use visual representation tool of all captured ECM functionalities in their FEF. The fifth article, ‘An empirical study of IS architectures in French SMEs: integration approaches’ co-authored by Marc Bidan and Frantz Rowe from Université de Nantes and Duane Truex from Georgia State University, proceeds first in clarifying an important theoretical construct often used but in different senses: the IS architecture. Then, it attempts to establish IS architecture taxonomies with clear recognisable characteristics applicable on the medium size firms through a study conducted over 143 French SMEs. Through a multivariate statistical analysis tool, it identifies the Silos Architecture category, the Partially Standardized Architecture category and the Mixed Architecture category. Finally, it uncovers paths by which SMEs work on integrating their IS architecture. This article's importance is twofold. First, its theoretical contribution towards a better understanding of what is exactly meant by IS architecture will hopefully help researchers in this field. Second, it presents new insights on how SMEs integrate (or not) their IS artefacts, in contrast with the previously established integration paths adopted by large sized firms. The sixth article co-authored by three colleagues from Louisiana State University: Andrew Schwarz, Sonja Wiley-Patton and Colleen Schwarz along with Yoohyuk Jung from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology and Benoga Perez-Mira from Northwestern State University entitled ‘Towards an understanding of assimilation in virtual worlds: the 3C approach’ discusses factors influencing the non assimilation on virtual world platforms with a special emphasis on Second Life. In their study, the gap of assimilation is practically viewed as the lack of use after signing up. The research teaches us that not only the discontinued use of the virtual world technology is influenced by technology class factors and by community class factors, but also by user class factors, hence the article's title the 3C's (three classes). The model expands on the TRA (the theory of reasoned action) that takes into account both the volitional and evaluative components and the normative influence component that drive the individual's behaviour. This article is undoubtedly a beginning in a series of investigations and research aiming at: (1) validating the model by extending it to other technologies and (2) exploring the comprehensiveness of the suggested factors in each class of non-assimilation impacting factors. In the seventh article, ‘Online game addiction among adolescents: motivation and prevention factors’, the authors Zhengchuan Xu from Fudan University in Shanghai, China; Ofir Turel from California State University; and Yufei Yuan from McMaster University in Canada propose a model of antecedent factors impacting online game addiction. The antecedents not only rely on motivating factors that push towards game playing addiction, but also take into consideration prevention and harm reduction efforts exerted to reduce online game addiction. The model is tested on some 623 adolescents in China and achieves more than 40% of factors contributing towards game addiction explanation. The implications of this study are of prime importance since it can help teachers, parents, governments and regulators control and prevent online game addiction which have been established to cause harm both physically and psychologically to those involved in this activity, as well as to their surrounding communities. The similarities and differences found between the last two articles are interesting to observe: one discusses the problem of technology non-assimilation, while the other researches technology addiction. Both articles relate to virtual world technologies, which is a growing technology area and definitely worth studying to uncover its related ambiguities. While both articles start by drawing on Yee's article ‘Motivations for play in online games’ (2006), they broaden their research perspectives by relying on variant IS and non-IS literature.",

"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_Research_and_Innovation",,"Responsible Research and Innovation","Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) describes a research, development or innovation process that takes into account effects and potential impacts on the environment and society. It can be defined as ""a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society.""[1] The approach is and has been part of several European Framework Programmes and has been developed in scientific and technological publications in journals and conferences, as well as in projects. By June 2014, there were at least a dozen international research projects, most of them funded or co-funded by the European Commission, that were involved in developing a Responsible Research and Innovation governance framework.[2]

Apart from the well-known definition given in the first paragraph of this article, there are several other definitions of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI).

It ""refers to the comprehensive approach of proceeding in research and innovation in ways that allow all stakeholders that are involved in the processes of research and innovation at an early stage (A) to obtain relevant knowledge on the consequences of the outcomes of their actions and on the range of options open to them and (B) to effectively evaluate both outcomes and options in terms of societal needs and moral values and (C) to use these considerations (under A and B) as functional requirements for design and development of new research, products and services.""[3] The European Commission (EC) described RRI in an earlier publication as a framework that consisted of six key action points:[4]

According to Owen et al. (2012) there are three main features of RRI that overlap to a great extent with the EC Framework:[5]

According to Stilgoe et al. (2013), RRI has four dimensions:[6]

RRI is best understood as a higher level responsibility that aims to shape, develop, and align existing and future research and innovation-related processes.[7] The concept is applied mainly for science and technology-based research and innovation, in particular in the area of emerging technologies—notably nanotechnologies, Information and communications technology (ICT), genomics, synthetic biology and geo-engineering. However, some authors state that RRI could also encompass financial instruments, public policy or community innovations, distribution, service or system innovations.[8]

Responsible Research and Innovation is developed as an approach to governing research and innovation at the European Union level. It is ""reflected in many high-level policy, strategy and programming documents, such as the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy to create smart growth or the Horizon 2020 programme that defines tackling societal challenges as one of the main priorities.""[1]

The term RRI was coined in Europe and the United States in the first decade of the 21st century. Among the first authors who developed this concept from 2003 on were Hellstrom, Guston, Owen, and others (see the References section below).

At the European level the concept originates from visions for collaborations between social, natural and physical scientists that address the wider dimensions of science and innovation early on. Examples can be found within the 5th and 6th EU Framework Programmes and their calls for socio-technical integration.[9] More examples are calls for greater public engagement with science and technology.[10] According to Owen et al. (2012),[5] integrated approaches such as Technology assessment in its various forms, referring to publications from Schot and Rip (1996) and Guston and Sarewitz (2002), and anticipatory governance (see the paper by Karinen and Guston from 2010) are further roots of RRI. They claim that some of these features had been formalised within decision-making processes, such as the so-called ""Danish model"" for technology assessment based on public participation and deliberation, e.g. through consensus conferences (see [10]).

In the United States of America, many ideas that have shaped science policy emerged from the writings and influence of Vannevar Bush. Bush’s ""Science-The Endless Frontier"" (1945) proposed a civilian-led body to support research in the interest of meeting national goals. Bush attempted to design a system that pursued fundamental theoretical work and successfully connected it to application and societal needs.[11]

The European Commission stated in 2013 that because Responsible Research and Innovation was ""a cross-cutting action that is implemented throughout Horizon 2020, 0.5% of the budgets for the 'Societal Challenges' and 'Industrial Leadership' pillars of Horizon 2020 [was] earmarked for RRI/Science with and for Society actions.""[12] Innovation and new technologies should meet the global challenges such as climate change and global warming, the efficient use of natural resources, demographic change, global health and development, social cohesion and the maintenance of economic prosperity.[3]

It has been suggested that ""Grand Challenges""—tightening supplies of energy, water and food; pandemics; ageing societies; global warming; public health and security[13]—could be useful as a guiding force for RRI, in particular with regards to the criterion of societal desirability.[1] Another possible foundation for societal desirability with democratic legitimacy could be constitutional values.[14] Constitutional values of the European Union are ""respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Moreover, the societies of the Member States are characterised by pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men.""[15] Other values that play an important role in this context are the UN Global Compact's ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption.[16] Some member states of the European Union have the ambition to establish their own framework for RRI, so that national criteria and approaches are being developed and implemented. Here are some examples of these national initiatives and their funding in 2008:[8]

Even though Responsible Research and Innovation draws on the body of knowledge and experience provided by the history of Technology assessment over decades and on the methodological toolbox, it extends the scope of consideration to ethical issues of responsibility and to broader governance and science, technology and society (STS) issues.[17]

The main difference between Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and RRI is that the CSR approach tends to be industry-driven or rather ""an expression of corporate strategy, corporate identity, market power"".[18] CSR decisions are driven by the values of stakeholders by asking ""What do stakeholders care about?"". In contrast to that RRI establishes procedures to better integrate societal needs in the process of research and innovation and its methodology is centered on the equal roles and responsibility of societal actors and innovators.

Furthermore, CSR is mostly concerned with ethical acceptability (or legal responsibilities of human rights instruments) and sustainability (e.g. reducing pollution), not with societal desirability. This is illustrated by the United Nations Global Compact, a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles, which are concerning human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption.[19]

The principle of Creating Shared Value (CSV) starts where the UN Global Compact stops, namely how businesses can pursue social goals as part of their licence to operate. As such there is an overlap with RRI and its focus on societal desirability. However, the goal of CSV is to improve the competitiveness and economic profit of a company by addressing societal issues, whereas RRI ensures that science and innovation are ethically acceptable, sustainable and focused on societal benefits for society as a whole.

The term Corporate sustainability (also “sustainability” and “sustainable development”) communicates a company’s ambition to align its actions with the major social, environmental and economic changes that face society at large–and to prepare itself for the society of the future. However, it is about business in general and not specifically about Research and Innovation, has unidirectional top-down character and is not associated with collective responsibility, and civil society's engagement.",

 The situation 

 There is increasing scrutiny (and pressure) to explore ways of managing the development of new technologies with a view to both environmental and health risks as well as more broad societal effects. Moreover, there is pressure to do so at all stages of the innovation process (pressure of responsible research in laboratories, manufacturing legislature on nanoparticles, corporate social responsibility in industry etc.)

 

 With current explorations of means of achieving a responsible approach to nanotechnology (EU Action Plan & EU Open Consultation), principles for the oversight of nanotechnology 2007 (Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and others) and codes of conduct (European Nanotechnology Trade Alliance, Du Pont, the Nano Industries Association and others) it is time to take stock and look deeper into the notion of responsible research and development along the innovation chain. 

 

 The objective of this meeting is to explore and develop possible elements of a ""Best Nano Practice"" at each stage of the innovation chain (from laboratory to society) in anticipation of the increased emphasis on Responsible Research and Innovation. This increased emphasis can be seen in government funding programmes, the move towards corporate and social responsibility and pressures from other non-governmental actors such as NGOs and re-insurance groups. 

 

 The workshop will be divide in two parts, the former focussing on articulating what are key elements in a ""Best Nano Practice"" exploring issues of technology research, development and embedment into society. The second part will focus on suggestions of implementation and attribution of such nano practices in research, corporate sphere and in more formal regulation processes.

 

 The format will take the form of a 1-day workshop augmented by pre-circulated case studies and scenarios and will draw on representatives from research, industry, regulatory bodies, trade union representatives and NGOs to explore and develop suggestions for, and implementation of, a ""Best Nano Practice"".

"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-987_en.htm",,"Eurobarometer Responsible Research and Innovation, Science and Technology","Why has this Eurobarometer been conducted? This Eurobarometer was funded by the Science and Society programme of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7).1 It offers valuable insight into public opinion and is part of the wider effort by the European Commission to better engage citizens with science, research and innovation and promote responsible research and innovation. Following up to this Eurobarometer, a new activity will be launched in the coming months under the Science in Society Programme, using the Eurobarometer research infrastructure to conduct pan-European focus group research with citizens and stakeholders. These activities identify the expectations of citizens and stakeholders with regard to science, technology and innovation, which will help the Commission to shape policies and set priorities for research and innovation programmes. How do citizens perceive science and technology? Consistent with findings of earlier Eurobarometer surveys2, this Eurobarometer confirms that there is no rejection of the impetus towards innovation: the vast majority of Europeans have a positive view on science and technology. The 2013 Eurobarometer ‘Responsible Research and Innovation’ shows that 77% of EU citizens agree that science and technology have a positive impact on society, and the majority of respondents in each country think this way. There is however concern about their potential for negative consequences, and the speed of change they can cause on our ways of life. Furthermore, more than half of Europeans believe that when it comes to decisions made about science and technology, public dialogue is required (55%). This is also consistent with previous Eurobarometer surveys4, which indicate that public dialogue is especially desired when social values are at stake.3 The 2013 RRI Eurobarometer furthermore shows that at least half of all Europeans are interested in developments in science and technology (53%), although only 40% say they feel informed about them. Country level results illustrate that levels of information about developments in science and technology are not uniform, with Eastern and Southern countries less likely to feel informed: There is a strong positive correlation (r=0.74) between being informed about developments in science and technology and the level of innovation performance at national level. However, there is not a strong correlation between feeling informed about developments in science and technology and thinking that the influence of science on society is positive. Societal opinion on science and innovation is therefore not principally determined by ‘science literacy’. Other interesting findings are that eight out of ten respondents agree that the EU should actively promote worldwide respect for European ethical principles for conducting scientific research. Also, more than eight out of ten (86%) respondents think it is important that scientific research takes equal account of the needs of men and women. How do citizens perceive the actors involved in science and technology? University or government scientists (82%) and environmental protection associations (81%) are most likely to be seen as trying to behave responsibly towards society when it comes to decisions about science and technology. University or government scientists (66%) are also most likely to be seen as best qualified to explain the impact of scientific and technological developments on society, with scientists in private laboratories ranking second (35%). Government representatives are the least likely to be seen as trying to behave responsibly in this area (44%) and they are also very unlikely to be seen as best qualified to explain the impact of scientific and technological developments on society (6%). Socio-demographic analysis shows that there is a positive correlation between being more familiar with science and technology (in terms of education, interest, informed, family member in science) and being more likely to think for each group that it tries to behave responsibly towards society. No notable differences are found in opinion between men and women and there are also relatively few differences between age groups: How are citizens informed about science and technology? Overall just under half of all Europeans (47%) have studied science or technology. Furthermore, while 53 % of Europeans are interested in developments in science and technology, only 40% say they feel informed about them. There is therefore a need to support both formal and informal science education, especially in Southern and Eastern EU Member States where levels of feeling informed are relatively low. The survey shows that there is broad support for science education: most Europeans think that their government is doing too little to stimulate young people’s interest in science (65%). A majority also agree that an interest in science improves young people’s job prospects (59%), culture (72%), and their ability to act as well-informed citizens (68%). Television is the most mentioned source of information about developments in science and technology (65%), followed by the internet (35%) and newspapers (33%). What other activities will the European Commission support in this area? Following up to the various actions funded through the FP7 'Science in Society' programme, the Commission will continue to promote public engagement and responsible research and innovation, in particular via the next framework programme for research and innovation: Horizon 2020.4 Horizon 2020 has a strong orientation towards addressing the societal challenges faced by Europe and the World and actively seeks the input from stakeholders and citizens. Public engagement and 'Responsible research and Innovation (RRI)' are cross-cutting actions throughout Horizon 2020, furthermore supported by the 'Science with and for Society' objective that has been allocated a budget of 462 Million Euro.5 Also, representatives from civil society will be involved in Horizon 2020 External Advisory Boards and in the monitoring and evaluation of Horizon 2020 activities. As a concrete example of this drive to broaden and widen participation in Horizon 2020, the recent VOICES project aims to involve European citizens in the definition of research priorities in the area of urban waste.6 It was launched in 2013 under the 'Science in Society' programme of the 7th Framework Programme. Some 99 citizen panel discussions, involving a total of 990 citizens in all European countries, have been held and have provided ideas and expectations. The results of the consultation have been fed into the development of the Work Programme for the Societal Challenge 'Climate Action, Environment, Resource Efficiency and Raw Materials' of Horizon 2020.",

"http://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Responsible_Research_and_Innovation",,"Documents in Responsible Research and Innovation - Academia.edu","Social entrepreneurs can be seen as the ‘transformational leaders’ who combine entrepreneurship with a societal vision while building bridges between business, governments and citizens (Purdue, 2001). But how do they take up this role and act as change agents for societal transitions? It is their innovation which is essential for realizing these transitions. The emerging concept of ‘Responsible Research & Innovation’ (RRI), as a transformative and constructive approach (Owen et al., 2013), can help to understand how social entrepreneurs actually stimulate and shape these transitions, since it combines social and economic goals. RRI is a transparent, interactive process where involved actors become mutually responsive to each other, aiming for the innovation process and its marketable products being adopted by society (von Schomberg, 2011). 

 

Although, RRI has the potential to understand the transformational leadership of social entrepreneurship. The problem is that the field of corporate innovation is underexposed in current RRI research (cf. Blok, 2013). This raises the question: how in fact is RRI embedded in the innovation practices of social enterprises? 

In the literature, various reasons are identified why SMEs can have a predisposition for engaging in responsible innovation (Rodgers, 2010 in Halme & Korpela, 2013; Scholten et al., 2013). It is for instance assumed that they are to be more adaptive and responsive to society than (larger) firms or incumbents (Scholten et al., 2013).  However, it is still the question how exactly SMEs engage in RRI in practice and how they contribute to societal transitions. 

 

Social enterprises are an interesting subgroup of SMEs, and the units of analysis in this paper, because the goal to create social value through social innovations show resemblance with the goals of RRI (viz. a social, environmental and economic positive impact). Furthermore, in order to take care for the future, RRI should be for society and with society through responsive stewardship in the present (Stilgoe et al., 2013). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to answer the question: to what extent do social enterprises take responsibility into account in their innovation processes? 

 

To answer this question, we will do a content analyses on approximately 150 cases of social enterprises linked with climate change adaptation and mitigation in urban areas. The data will be obtained from the ope n database of Ashoka (largest network of social entrepreneurs worldwide). Their platform shares elaborate case descriptions of social enterprises with regard to: the problem that the social enterprises address, the ideas that they have, the strategies to solve to problem and personal information about the social entrepreneurs. These social entrepreneurs provide information via a five step process with regard to: newness, creativity, entrepreneurial quality, social impact and ethical fibre. 

 

In order to do such a content analysis, we will first develop a theoretical framework with all the relevant elements of industrial RRI processes, based on a review of the RRI literature (e.g. goals, ethics, stakeholder involvement, technology assessment). Subsequently, we will code the case descriptions based on the operationalized indicators, which implies a deductive content analysis.

"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-987_en.htm",,"Eurobarometer Responsible Research and Innovation, Science and Technology","Why has this Eurobarometer been conducted? This Eurobarometer was funded by the Science and Society programme of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7).1 It offers valuable insight into public opinion and is part of the wider effort by the European Commission to better engage citizens with science, research and innovation and promote responsible research and innovation. Following up to this Eurobarometer, a new activity will be launched in the coming months under the Science in Society Programme, using the Eurobarometer research infrastructure to conduct pan-European focus group research with citizens and stakeholders. These activities identify the expectations of citizens and stakeholders with regard to science, technology and innovation, which will help the Commission to shape policies and set priorities for research and innovation programmes. How do citizens perceive science and technology? Consistent with findings of earlier Eurobarometer surveys2, this Eurobarometer confirms that there is no rejection of the impetus towards innovation: the vast majority of Europeans have a positive view on science and technology. The 2013 Eurobarometer ‘Responsible Research and Innovation’ shows that 77% of EU citizens agree that science and technology have a positive impact on society, and the majority of respondents in each country think this way. There is however concern about their potential for negative consequences, and the speed of change they can cause on our ways of life. Furthermore, more than half of Europeans believe that when it comes to decisions made about science and technology, public dialogue is required (55%). This is also consistent with previous Eurobarometer surveys4, which indicate that public dialogue is especially desired when social values are at stake.3 The 2013 RRI Eurobarometer furthermore shows that at least half of all Europeans are interested in developments in science and technology (53%), although only 40% say they feel informed about them. Country level results illustrate that levels of information about developments in science and technology are not uniform, with Eastern and Southern countries less likely to feel informed: There is a strong positive correlation (r=0.74) between being informed about developments in science and technology and the level of innovation performance at national level. However, there is not a strong correlation between feeling informed about developments in science and technology and thinking that the influence of science on society is positive. Societal opinion on science and innovation is therefore not principally determined by ‘science literacy’. Other interesting findings are that eight out of ten respondents agree that the EU should actively promote worldwide respect for European ethical principles for conducting scientific research. Also, more than eight out of ten (86%) respondents think it is important that scientific research takes equal account of the needs of men and women. How do citizens perceive the actors involved in science and technology? University or government scientists (82%) and environmental protection associations (81%) are most likely to be seen as trying to behave responsibly towards society when it comes to decisions about science and technology. University or government scientists (66%) are also most likely to be seen as best qualified to explain the impact of scientific and technological developments on society, with scientists in private laboratories ranking second (35%). Government representatives are the least likely to be seen as trying to behave responsibly in this area (44%) and they are also very unlikely to be seen as best qualified to explain the impact of scientific and technological developments on society (6%). Socio-demographic analysis shows that there is a positive correlation between being more familiar with science and technology (in terms of education, interest, informed, family member in science) and being more likely to think for each group that it tries to behave responsibly towards society. No notable differences are found in opinion between men and women and there are also relatively few differences between age groups: How are citizens informed about science and technology? Overall just under half of all Europeans (47%) have studied science or technology. Furthermore, while 53 % of Europeans are interested in developments in science and technology, only 40% say they feel informed about them. There is therefore a need to support both formal and informal science education, especially in Southern and Eastern EU Member States where levels of feeling informed are relatively low. The survey shows that there is broad support for science education: most Europeans think that their government is doing too little to stimulate young people’s interest in science (65%). A majority also agree that an interest in science improves young people’s job prospects (59%), culture (72%), and their ability to act as well-informed citizens (68%). Television is the most mentioned source of information about developments in science and technology (65%), followed by the internet (35%) and newspapers (33%). What other activities will the European Commission support in this area? Following up to the various actions funded through the FP7 'Science in Society' programme, the Commission will continue to promote public engagement and responsible research and innovation, in particular via the next framework programme for research and innovation: Horizon 2020.4 Horizon 2020 has a strong orientation towards addressing the societal challenges faced by Europe and the World and actively seeks the input from stakeholders and citizens. Public engagement and 'Responsible research and Innovation (RRI)' are cross-cutting actions throughout Horizon 2020, furthermore supported by the 'Science with and for Society' objective that has been allocated a budget of 462 Million Euro.5 Also, representatives from civil society will be involved in Horizon 2020 External Advisory Boards and in the monitoring and evaluation of Horizon 2020 activities. As a concrete example of this drive to broaden and widen participation in Horizon 2020, the recent VOICES project aims to involve European citizens in the definition of research priorities in the area of urban waste.6 It was launched in 2013 under the 'Science in Society' programme of the 7th Framework Programme. Some 99 citizen panel discussions, involving a total of 990 citizens in all European countries, have been held and have provided ideas and expectations. The results of the consultation have been fed into the development of the Work Programme for the Societal Challenge 'Climate Action, Environment, Resource Efficiency and Raw Materials' of Horizon 2020.",

Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) aims to bring together researchers, citizens, policy makers, businesses and educators to cooperate during the entire research and innovation process in order to align the outcomes of research with the values and needs of society.

RRI is a cross-cutting issue in the European Commission ‘Horizon 2020’ Framework Programme. Its ultimate ambition is to address the great challenges of our time (climate change, energy, health, etc.) and to encourage smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe. It is still an emerging concept and, in order to implement RRI, concrete tools are needed. This is where our project steps in.

RRI Tools is a project funded for three years (2014-2016) by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (FP7). A 26 members’ Consortium has been set up, extending across 30 countries in the European Research Area.

This project aims to develop a Toolkit to help in the implementation of Responsible Research and Innovation in Europe. Collaborating with all stakeholders, it will help create a Community of Practice in Europe, which will ensure the use, evolution and enrichment of the Toolkit. In order to build this Community of Practice, the Consortium relies on 19 national centres, the RRI Hubs, responsible for opening participation to the maximum number of institutions and individuals in the field.The project is divided into three phases and is based on a permanent dialogue with all the stakeholders.

"http://www.eisri-summit.eu/introduction/",,"EISRI-Summit 2014","The III EISRI 2014 entitled Science, Media and Democracy focuses on the importance of citizen-centred approaches to science and innovation in the European Union and is designed to create a unique opportunity for intersectoral and interdisciplinary discussion between leading stakeholders to:

 • Create a debate at the level of heads of state and leading thinkers on the role of knowledge in the digital age reflecting the challenges and opportunities of the new media environment;

 • Showcase global best practices and assess the most efficient ways how different stakeholders can contribute to this endeavour;

 • Support intersectoral dialogue with the public at large on these themes and engage the public through the participation and cooperation of the European newspapers engaged in the Permanent Platform of Atomium Culture;

 • Present concrete solutions and recommendations on the discussed problems and challenges having in mind both short-term and long-term perspectives.

The European Intersectoral Summit on Research and Innovation is the first European meeting for research and innovation designed to bring together top political leaders from Europe and key representatives from media, businesses and research institutions.

 The dedicated workshops will be designed to reflect the key issues in this area and to promote “out of the box” thinking and participatory processes.",

We are currently accepting applications, via UCAS, for entry in Sept 2015

 On our degrees, students investigate what scientists do, their role in our society, history and culture, and the policies and debates shaping our modern scientific and technological world.  Our graduates have gone on to a wide variety of careers including: broadcasting, local government, law, education, environmental protection, science policy research, museums and science centres, as well as academic research and teaching. Find out more via the links below

Our catalogue of modules is now available:  We use the prefix ""HPSC"" for all modules in Science and Technology Studies.  For more information, you have three routes. Start with:  STS Head of Department, Professor Joe Cain, sums up the catalogue with a smile, ""This is an exciting list. We've plenty of long-time favourites. Plus, we have many new modules, some offered by staff new to the department. There's something here for everyone.""  Last year, STS took a close look at our curriculum to ensure our modules we're forward-looking, research-led, and careers-focused. Keep an look out for our new modules. HPSC3040    Science, Politics and the State in Russia and the Soviet Union HPSC3053    Globalization in Theory and Practice  (** - new)

For those arriving to study in September 2014, this year's STS OneBook selection: Dear, Peter. 2008. The Intelligibility of Nature: How Science Makes Sense of the World (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).  Order Amazon UK paperback | publisher | many secondhand copies are available, too: www.abebooks.co.uk

Our OneBook selection for 2014 ""considers how science as such has evolved and how it has marshalled itself to make sense of the world"". The goals of our 'OneBook' programme are: 1. increase intellectual integration across disparate courses

2. increase common ground for students in different year groups

3. encourage informal learning Each year, the Department asks all staff and students to read one book in common during the summer, then arrive for the new session ready to discuss both its substance and its broader value. Incoming students should read this prescribed book. It will be the subject of activities during induction week and will be used in Year1 courses. We're in our eighth year Ron Number's Galileo Goes to Jail, and other myths about science and religion Jon Turney's The Rough Guide to The Future Bill Bryson's Seeing Further: The Story of Science and the Royal Society: 350 Years of the Royal Society and Scientific Endeavour STS OneBook was praised highly by UCL's quality review team in their 2012 regular audit of the department. It was described as innovative and key to creating a shared learning enviroment.",
