Release History
---------------

1.1.2 (2014-09-19)
++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Cleans up the abundance calculation code and moves the output_relative_abundance() method to the biom_relative_abundance.py script.
- Modifies name extraction from each OTU level so that underscores in the name (after the initial double underscore) are allowed.
- Adds more detail and project badges (downloads,version,format) to the README.

**Bug Fixes**

- Restores accidental reversion of commit 9413c64 introduced by commit 91d6a39.

1.1.1 (2014-09-16)
++++++++++++++++++

The most notable change is the project is now structured to be installable via setuptools and compatible with (and available on) PyPI:

$ pip install qiime-setuptools

Or if you prefer to build from source:

$ python setup.py install


**Additions and Improvements**

- SLURM template added for use with the multi_parallel_pick_otus script.
- New otu_calc module for working with abundance tables (BIOM) and providing calculations such as Shannon Diversity and relative abundance.
- otu_tax_name.py now handles classic (tsv) BIOM tables in addition to simple lists of OTU IDs.
- New script filter_keep_otus_by_sample.py as the opposite of the QIIME script filter_otus_by_sample.py

**Bug Fixes**

- In iTol.py: fixes an issue where some or all of the OTU IDs in a newick-format tree have single-quotes surrounding them ('OTU_ID'), causing the script to crash.
- otu_name_biom() in the otu_calc method now returns a value as it was meant to
