        =============
        
        Yet another multimedia/dynamic portlet for Plone that display images.
        
        Why you can want this instead of other? Because it works with Javascript disabled (with an eye
        onto the `Italian Accessibility Act`__) and is tested to work behind reverse-proxy (like
        `Varnish`__).

           How the portlet looks like on AUSL web site
        
        How to use
        ----------
        
        The main information you must provide to the portlet is a Plone collection. The collection is
        used to retrieve all image-like contents from it. You can freely configure the collection to
        return also other content, but only ones marked as "image-able" are used (technically speaking:
        it also filter only contents that provides *IImageContent*, like "Image" and "News Item" content
        type already do).
        
        From the target collection is also used the "*Number of items*" field, to show in the portlet only
        a limited number of images.
        
        The "*Limit Search Results*" field is not directly used by this portlet, but change the collection
        behaviour. Enabling the client random feature with this check selected will only reorder a limited
        set of images.
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        What scare us about other Javascript-live multimedia portlet (besides accessibility) is the massive
        use of AJAX call to the server. This can lead to two problems:
        
        * too many request (and low performance)
        * random feature could work badly with cache in front of Plone
        
        For this reason this portlet will not query every *xyz* seconds the server, but simply get from
        the server all the images, then randomly reload them client side.
        
        The *auto-reload feature* can be disabled if you don't like it. You still have a random image
        set at page load time.
        
        Translations
        ------------
        
        When using client side reload feature, the user can (for accessibility reason) stop and restart the
        auto-reload task.
        
        The portlet title will display an help message. To add additional translation you are able to *not*
        change the product source.
        
        Just add something like this in one of your Javascript source::
        
            jQuery.auslfe_multimedia = {
                i18n: {
                    xx: {
                        stopReload: '"Click to stop auto-reload" in xx language',
                        restartReload: '"Click to restart auto-reload" in xx language'
                    }
                }
            };
        
        Change *xx* above with the 2-letters code of your language and customize other strings.
        Language loaded is taken from the language of the site (for any problem, fallback on english).
