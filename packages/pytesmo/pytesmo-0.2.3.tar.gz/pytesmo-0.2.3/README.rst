Introduction to pytesmo a python Toolbox for the Evaluation of Soil Moisture Observations
=========================================================================================

pytesmo is a package which aims it is to provide a standard library that can be used for the comparison and validation
of geospatial time series datasets with a focus on soil moisture.

It contains an expanding collection of readers for different soil moisture datasets (see `Supported Datasets`_) as well as routines for comparing them.
Special classes in the module :mod:`pytesmo.grid` provide easy nearest neighbor searching between datasets as well as
the calculation of lookup tables of nearest neighbours. They also provide possibilities to easily read all
grid points of a dataset in the correct order.

It contains the code used for the calculation of metrics by the
`Satellite Soil Moisture Validation Tool For ASCAT <http://rs.geo.tuwien.ac.at/validation_tool/ascat.html>`_. See :mod:`pytesmo.metrics`.



Features
========

* easily read data from the `Supported Datasets`_
* anomaly calculation based on climatology or using a moving window see :mod:`pytesmo.anomaly`
* easy temporal matching of time series see :mod:`pytesmo.temporal_matching`
* multiple methods for scaling between different observation domains (CDF matching, linear regreesion, min-max matching) see :mod:`pytesmo.scaling`
* calculate standard metrics like correlation coefficients, RMSD, bias,
  as well as more complex ones like triple collocation or MSE as a decomposition of the RMSD see :mod:`pytesmo.metrics`
