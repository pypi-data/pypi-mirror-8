********

Reading and plotting ASCAT H25 data from netCDF format
======================================================

This Example script reads and plots ASCAT H25 SSM data with different masking options
and also converts the data to absolute values using the included porosity data.
It can be found in the /examples folder of the pytesmo package under the name read_ASCAT_H25.py

If the standard file names assumed by the script have changed this can be specified during initialization of the AscatH25_SSM object.
Please see the documentation of :class:`pytesmo.io.sat.ascat.AscatH25_SSM`

.. include::
   read_ASCAT_H25.rst

Reading and plotting H-SAF images
=================================

`H-SAF <http://hsaf.meteoam.it/soil-moisture.php>`_ provides three different image products:

* SM OBS 1 - H07 - Large scale surface soil moisture by radar scatterometer in BUFR format over Europe
* SM OBS 2 - H08 - Small scale surface soil moisture by radar scatterometer in BUFR format over Europe
* SM DAS 2 - H14 - Profile index in the roots region by scatterometer data assimilation in GRIB format, global

The following example will show how to read and plot each of them.
It can be found in the /examples folder of the pytesmo package under the name Read_H_SAF_images.py

.. include::
   Read_H_SAF_images.rst


Reading and plotting data from the ISMN
=======================================

This example program chooses a random Network and Station and plots the first variable,depth,sensor
combination. To see how to get data for a variable from all stations see the next example.

It can be found in the /examples folder of the pytesmo package under the name plot_ISMN_data.py.

.. include::
   plot_ISMN.rst


Calculating anomalies and climatologies
=======================================

This Example script reads and plots ASCAT H25 SSM data. The :mod:`pytesmo.time_series.anomaly` module
is then used to calculate anomalies and climatologies of the time series.
It can be found in the /examples folder of the pytesmo package under the name anomalies.py

.. include::
   anomalies.rst


Comparing ASCAT and insitu data from the ISMN
=============================================

This example program loops through all insitu stations that measure soil moisture with a depth between 0 and 0.1m
it then finds the nearest ASCAT grid point and reads the ASCAT data. After temporal matching and scaling using linear CDF matching it computes
several metrics, like the correlation coefficients(Pearson's, Spearman's and Kendall's), Bias, RMSD as well as the Nashâ€“Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient.

It also shows the usage of the :mod:`pytesmo.df_metrics` module.

It is stopped after 2 stations to not take to long to run and produce a lot of plots

It can be found in the /examples folder of the pytesmo package under the name compare_ISMN_ASCAT.py.

.. include::
   compare_ASCAT_ISMN.rst

Reading and plotting ASCAT data from binary format
==================================================

This example program reads and plots ASCAT SSM and SWI data with different masking options.
It can be found in the /examples folder of the pytesmo package under the name plot_ASCAT_data.py.

.. include::
   plot_ascat_data.rst
