== YubiKey NEO Manager
Tool for managing your YubiKey NEO configuration. Connecting multiple keys at
once is supported, but only if CCID mode is active for all of them.

=== Dependencies
YubiKey NEO Manager requires PySide, libykneomgr, yubikey-personalization and
libu2f-host.

=== Running tests
Tests can be run using the "nosetests" command, from the python-nose package.
Anternatively "python setup.py test" can be used, but this will cause PySide
to be compiled from source, requiring the python-dev package.

=== Building binaries
Binaries for Windows and OSX are built using PyInstaller.

Clone the git repository and checkout the desired release tag (or branch):

  git clone https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-neo-manager.git
  cd yubikey-neo-manager

When building binaries for Windows or OS X, you will need to include
.dll/.dylib files from the libykneomgr, yubikey-personalization, and
libu2f-host projects.
Download the correct binary release for your architecture for each of the 
aforementioned projects from http://developers.yubico.com/ and extract the 
.dll/.dylib files for each of them together with the included dependencies to a
subdirectory of the repository named "lib", which you have to manually create.

==== Windows
For Windows you will need python, PySide, PyCrypto, PyInstaller and Pywin32 installed
(32 or 64-bit versions depending on the architecture of the binary your are
building).

To sign the executable, copy the pfx file to neoman.pfx and place it in the
root of the project folder. You will need signtool.exe (from the Windows
SDK) either copied into the root as well or in a location in your PATH.

Run "pyinstaller.exe neoman.spec" from the main project folder.

With NSIS installed, a Windows installer will be built as well.

==== OSX
For OSX you need python, pyside, pycrypto, and pyinstaller installed. One way 
to install these dependencies is by using Homebrew:

  brew install python
  brew install pyside
  pip install PyInstaller
  pip install pycrypto

NOTE: Homebrew will build backwards-incompatible binaries, so the resulting
build will not run on an older version of OSX.

Run "pyinstaller neoman.spec" from the main project directory. This will create
an .app in the dist directory.

Sign the code using codesign:

  codesign -s 'Developer ID Application' dist/YubiKey\ NEO\ Manager.app --deep

There is also a project file for use with Packages
(http://s.sudre.free.fr/Packaging.html) located at resources/neoman.pkgproj.
This can be used to create an installer for distribution, which you should sign
prior to distribution:

  productsign --sign 'Developer ID Installer' dist/YubiKey\ NEO\ Manager.pkg dist/yubikey-neo-manager-mac.pkg
