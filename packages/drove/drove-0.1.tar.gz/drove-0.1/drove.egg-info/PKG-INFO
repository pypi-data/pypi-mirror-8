Description: # drove
        
        *drove* is a modern monitoring tool which support alerting
        (with escalation), auto-register nodes, statistics gathering
        and much more... in a few lines of python code.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The stable releases of drove will be uploaded to
        [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), so you can install
        and upgrade versions using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):
        
            pip install drove
        
        You can use unstable versions at your risk using pip as well:
        
           pip install -e git://github.com/ajdiaz/drove
        
        By the way: *drove* works better with python3, but 2.7 is also
        supported.
        
        ## Usage
        
        You need to configure *drove* to enable the features that you
        like to use. In fact *drove* act as a producer-consumer daemon,
        which means that there are read _plugins_ and write
        _plugins_.
        
        - A *reader* read a metric or an event from somewhere and
          report it to *drove* (in a internal cache).
        
        - A *consumer* write a metric (taken from the internal cache)
          in somewhere.
        
        Some _plugins_ can act as reader and writer at the same time.
        
        By default *drove* start with a very basic readers configured.
        
        To start the daemon just type:
        
            drove -c myconfig.conf
        
        You can avoid to daemonize with `--no-daemon` option in the
        command line.
