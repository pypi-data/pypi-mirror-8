"""
Computer configuration file
===========================

Specify default settings for all computers where you run your experiment such
as a monitor size or root path to storing data. This is intended as a more
portable and extended version of PsychoPy's MonitorCenter.

A computer is recognized by its mac address which is dependent on its
hardware and by its name. In the future versions of psychopy_ext,
if anything in the hardware changes, you'll see a warning.
