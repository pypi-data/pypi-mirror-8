v0.5.5
--------
* NEW: Can now record frame timing. Events (in the trial structure creation) now have a keyword "name". If you provide, the timing of that event will be recorded.
* FIXED (hopefully): integration to git.
* FIXED: Minor bug fixes related to the installation, subplots, and MouseResp parameters.

v0.5.4
------
* IMPROVED: Rewrote plot and stats modules to better integrate with pandas' desire to reduce DataFrames into Series whenever possible. So the resulting code should be more robust now. Moreover, the information about splitting of data into rows and cols is now kept separately in the ``_splits`` variable so that the names of rows and columns are not messed up anymore. Downside: you have to manually assign this attribute to the DataFrame after most operations with the DataFrame.
* IMPROVED: The default fixation spot is now without the grey cross that was occluding background before.

v0.5.3
------
* NEW: Generate synthetic fMRI data using ``fmri.GenHRF()``.
* IMPROVED: ploting ROIs, chunks, datasets
* CHANGED: ``exp.create_win`` takes kwargs

v0.5.2
------
* NEW: A prototype of Analyzer for an interactive data analysis! (undocumented; you can try it with ``import psychopy_ext.analyzer; psychopy_ext.analyzer.run())
* NEW: MouseRespGroup for mouse response displays.
* NEW: Error bars and confidence intervals for repeated measures using Loftus & Masson (1994).
* NEW: GridSpec support in plot.
* FIXED: Installation requirements are more loose now. Pure Python packages are installed on the go with pip. Non-pure required Python packages stop installation and tell you what to install manually. Non-pure recommended Python packages allow you to install psychopy_ext but give a warning about what's missing. Also, tries to complain about missing dependencies only when you explicitly need them.
* CHANGED: Info parameter now has 'repository' parameter instead of 'register' and 'push'. You can choose to either 'commit and push' (default) or 'only commit'. This should be more transparent. Moreover, exp.Experiment.run_exp() has been changes such that the whole committing and pushing thing occurs in the exp.Experiment.after_exp().
* CHANGED: keyword 'unstack' in ``stats.aggregate()`` is now 'unstacked' because of the new ``stats.unstack()`` function
* FIXED: In older PsychoPy versions, BaseVisualStim is _BaseVisualStim, so now accepting both.
* IMPROVED: last_keypress now always returns a list (that might be empty)
* IMPROVED: can call a custom method for analyzing fMRI data
* FIXED: Plotting and stats are more robust now.
* FIXED: compactibility with pandas 0.13+ (FrozenList issues and interactive plots causing no display)

v0.5.1.1
--------
* FIXED: mouse inherited from Exp to Task
* DEMOS: updated post_trial syntax

v0.5.1
------
* NEW: Experimental support for mouse inputs (with a demo)
* NEW: Experimental support for exporting displays to SVG (Circle, Line, Rect, ShapeStim, TextStim, ThickShapeStim)
* NEW: demo of the shortest  fully functional experiment possible
* FIXED: ThickLineStim can now accept default units for lineWidth
* FIXED: reoder
* ADDED: testing for demos
* FIXED: exp seed creation. Should now reinitialize seeds for each task and for each block.
* FIXED: GUI auto fit to contents in no size passed
* ADDED: write time stamp of the stat and finish of the experiment
* ADDED: psychopy_ext version in log
* FIXED: registering was not implemented even though Experiment was already using it
* FIXED: trial number printed at the begining, not at the end of the trial
* FIXED: GroupStim now properly converts stimuli to list
