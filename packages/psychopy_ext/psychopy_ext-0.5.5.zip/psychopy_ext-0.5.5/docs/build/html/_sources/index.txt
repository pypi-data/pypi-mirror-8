Welcome to psychopy_ext documentation!
======================================

``psychopy_ext`` is a framework for a rapid reproducible design, analysis and plotting of experiments in neuroscience and psychology.

Unlike ``PsychoPy``, ``PyMVPA`` or ``matplotlib`` that are very flexible and support multiple options to suit everyoneâ€™s needs, the underlying philosophy of ``psychopy_ext`` is to act as the glue at a higher level of operation by choosing reasonable defaults for these packages and providing patterns for common tasks with a minimal user intervention. Set up your stimuli, trial structure and go! Everything else is already done for you.
