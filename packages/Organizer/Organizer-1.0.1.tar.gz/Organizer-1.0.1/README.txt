This distribution of my organizer is my first distribution I have decided to share,
and I have much to learn about Python.  It contains three modules.  It has OrganizerTools.py
which has the classes and functions which do the work of the program.  The other two are
two different user interfaces which both use OrganizerTools.  OrganizerMain is a text based
user interface, and is the one I have been using and developing for longer.  OrganizerG is
a graphical user interface that I made more recently.  Comments would appreciated, as I am
still learning.

I am using Python version 2.7.6
