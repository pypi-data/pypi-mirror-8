iwlib - interface with wireless tools in Linux
==============================================

iwlib is a package for interfacing with iwlib, providing an implementation to
the wireless tools in Linux.

While very incomplete at the moment, it aims to eventually become a complete
implementation, as features become necessary. If you find some functionality
missing, feel free to contribute to the project, or create an issue on the bug
tracker.

Currently it provides what I consider the bare minimum to become useful -
scanning, setting the ESSID of a device, and getting the current configuration
back from a device.

Installation
------------

Installation requires the Python developer tools, and wireless_tools package
for compilation. If Python.h and iwlib.h exist on your system, you should be
good to go.

    $ pip install iwlib
