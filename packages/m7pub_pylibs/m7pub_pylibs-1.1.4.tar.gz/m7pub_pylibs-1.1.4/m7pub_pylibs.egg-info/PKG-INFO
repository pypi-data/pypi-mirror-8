Description: m7pubpylibs (MARIMORE Open Source Python Libraries)
        =====================================
        A set of basic utilities, libraries and python code being used 
        by other packages in MARIMORE Inc.
        
        To install, run ``python setup.py install``.
        
        For development, use ``make develop`` to create symlink from python ``site-packages` dir to the working directory so you don't have to reinstall to test changes.
        
        To test packaging, run ``make install_dist`` which would generate the ``sdist`` tarball first and install from that tarball.
        
        To uninstall, run ``make uninstall``.
