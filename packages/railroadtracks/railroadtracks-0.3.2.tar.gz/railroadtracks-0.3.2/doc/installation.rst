Requirements
------------

This was developed for Python 2.7. 

.. note:: 

   While a keen attention has been paid to compatibility with Python 3,
   the use of metaclasses in this packages and the incompatibility of syntax with them 
   between Python 2 and 3 prevents this package from currently working with Python 3.
   This is the major blocker for Python 3-compatibility and we plan on using :mod:`six`
   to solve this.

A number of python packages are required or recommended (all of which are available on `Pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`):

- `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`
- `networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`
- `pygraphviz <https://pygraphviz.github.io/>`
- `enum34 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34>`
- `ngs_plumbing <http://pythonhosted.org/ngs_plumbing/>`

The model steps included require a number of third-party tools in order to have all steps working.
A missing tool does not prevent this package from working, but the related functionality
will not be working.

At the time of writing, the tools are:

- `samtools <http://samtools.sourceforge.net>`
- `bowtie <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/>`
- `bowtie2 <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2>`
- `tophat <http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml>`
- `tophat2 <http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml>`
- `GSNAP <http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/>`
- `sailfish <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/software/sailfish/>`
- `STAR <https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR>`
- `HTSeq <http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq>` (for the executable `htseq-count`)
- `R <http://www.r-project.org>`, with libraries:
    - `rjson <http://cran.r-project.org/package=rjson>` (required for any interaction with R)
  and bioconductor libraries
    - `Rsubread <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rsubread.html>` (for `featureCount`)
    - `DESeq <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html>`
    - `DESeq2 <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html>`
    - `limma <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html>` (for the method `voom`)
    - `edgeR <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html>`

.. note::

   Running the tests with `-v` (see below) will tell which tools are missing to have all functionality.


The package is including a small genome
(Enterobacteria phage MS2 isolate ST4 retrieved from the NCBI site: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EF204940.1 - 
bibliographic reference `Friedman SD et al., J Virol. 2009 Nov;83(21):11233-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01308-09. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2772794/>`) as FASTA, as well as
GTF/GFF derived from its genome annotation, for the purpose of running tests and examples.

Installation
------------

.. note-installation-slide-begin

This is a regular Python package. It can be installed with

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py install


Running the unit-tests can be done after installation

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m railroadtracks.tests # for a detail of the tests, add "-v"

.. note-installation-slide-end


.. note::

   While the unit tests use a very small dataset included in the package (a viral genome),
   running the test can take a bit of disk space (for instance, at the time of writing
   STAR indexes take a rather large amount of space for an otherwise rather small genome).
