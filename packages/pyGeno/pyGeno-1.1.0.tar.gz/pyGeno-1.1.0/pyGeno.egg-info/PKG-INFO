Description: pyGeno: A python package for Personalized Proteogenomics
        =======================
        
        pyGeno is a python package mainly intended for personal medicine applications that revolve around genomics and proteomics. It integrates reference sequences and annotations, genomic polymorphisms from the dbSNP database and data from next-gen sequencing into an easy to use, memory- efficient and fast framework, therefore allowing the user to easily explore human’s specific genomes and proteomes. Compared to a standalone program, pyGeno gives the user access to the complete expressivity of python, a general programming language. It’s range of application therefore encompasses both short scripts and large scale genome-wide studies.
