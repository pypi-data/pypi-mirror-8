        Short description:
        ------------------
        
        With pyGeno you can do that:
        
        .. code:: python
        
         from pyGeno.Genome import *
         
         #load a genome 
         ref = Genome(name = 'GRCh37.75')
         #load a gene
         gene = ref.get(Gene, name = 'TPST2')[0]
         #print the sequences of all the isoforms
         for prot in gene.get(Protein) :
          print prot.sequence
        
        You can also do it for the **specific genomes** of your subjects:
        
        .. code:: python
        
         pers = Genome(name = 'GRCh37.75', SNPs = ["RNA_S1"], SNPFilter = myFilter())

        --------------------
        
        pyGeno is a python package mainly intended for personal 
        medicine applications that revolve around genomics and 
        proteomics. It integrates reference sequences and 
        annotations, genomic polymorphisms from the dbSNP database 
        and data from next-gen sequencing into an easy to use, 
        memory- efficient and fast framework, therefore allowing 
        the user to easily explore human’s specific genomes and 
        proteomes. Compared to a standalone program, pyGeno gives
        the user access to the complete expressivity of 
        python, a general programming language. It’s range of application
        therefore encompasses both short scripts and large scale genome-wide studies.
