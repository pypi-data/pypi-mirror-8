pyGeno: A python package for Personalized Proteogenomics
=========================================================

pyGeno is a python package mainly intended for personal 
medicine applications that revolve around genomics and 
proteomics. It integrates reference sequences and 
annotations, genomic polymorphisms from the dbSNP database 
and data from next-gen sequencing into an easy to use, 
memory- efficient and fast framework, therefore allowing 
the user to easily explore human’s specific genomes and 
proteomes. Compared to a standalone program, pyGeno gives
the user access to the complete expressivity of 
python, a general programming language. It’s range of application
 therefore encompasses both short scripts and large scale genome-wide studies.
