SmoothTest
==========

General purpose Testing Utilities and also special testing tools for Web
Applications

How to use smoothtest
---------------------

The main utility is the ``autotest`` command. This command monitors your
project's files and you unittest files for changes, it will trigger
reloading and rerunning tests when a file changes. This means you can
work in your code and see how tests are affected automatically. You can
select a group of tests files to be monitored - that trigger partial
reloads of those same modules - and an group of files or directories to
trigger full reloads of the project.

It also provides a ipython UI interface to modify certain values and
re-test.

Do

::

    python -m smoothtest.autotest.Command

To enter the Ipython UI without specifying any initial test.

If you want to start with a specific test, run this to get possible
arguments.

::

    python -m smoothtest.autotest.Command --help

Inside Ipython you you have to commands

::

    %autotest
    %test

Where ``%autotest`` has same parameters as the
``python -m smoothtest.autotest.Command`` command but adds ``-u`` for
updating test parameters and ``-f`` for forcing a reloading.

Autotest command is still in beta stage, so some functionality won't be
as reliable as expected. (but still useful for developing tests) You may
need to restart the autotest command from time to time.

Configuration
-------------

You will need a ``smoothtest_settings.py`` in your ``PYTHONPATH`` that
looks like this:

::

    from smoothtest.settings.default import DefaultSettings
    import logging

    class Settings(DefaultSettings):
        web_server_url = 'http://localhost:8011/'

        webdriver_browser = 'Firefox' #'Chrome' 'PhantomJS'
        webdriver_pooling = True
        webdriver_inmortal_pooling = True
        webdriver_keep_open = False
        webdriver_log_level = logging.WARNING

Installing
----------

You can use pip to install it:

::

    pip install smoothtest 

Or uninstall it:

::

    pip uninstall smoothtest 

Windows and Mac OSX
-------------------

Smoothtest was designed to be multiplatform, although I still haven't
fully tested it, more to come soon.
