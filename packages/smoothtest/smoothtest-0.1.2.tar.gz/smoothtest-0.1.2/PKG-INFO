        How to use smoothtest
        ---------------------
        
        The main utility is the ``autotest`` command you can run it with:
        
        ::
        
            python -m smoothtest.autotest.Command
            #or to get options
            python -m smoothtest.autotest.Command --help
        
        Windows and Mac OSX
        -------------------
        
        Smoothtest was designed to be multiplatform, although I still haven't
        fully tested it, more to come soon.
