0.6 (2014-10-10)
----------------

Custom email subject and blurb.

- Feature #10 - DocuSignBackend.create_signature accepts ``subject`` and
  ``blurb`` arguments, in order to customize email subject and body for
  DocuSign messages and embedded signing page.


0.5 (2014-10-08)
----------------

Improvements around multiple signers.

- Feature #13 - ``DocuSignCallbackView`` also handles recipient notifications.

- Feature #11 - Improved ordering of signers, better management of DocuSign's
  ``routingOrder``.

- Feature #12 - Demo project shows how to implement signature of multiple

- Bugfix #9 - Fixed default value of ``signer_return_url`` in

  if value was not passed as argument.


0.4 (2014-09-26)
----------------

- Feature #7 - Introduced ``django_docusign.SignatureCallbackView``, as a

----------------

Updated demo to manage DocuSign API callbacks.

  useful parts in ``django_docusign`` package.
