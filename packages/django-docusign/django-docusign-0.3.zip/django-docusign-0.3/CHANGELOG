0.3 (2014-09-18)
----------------

Updated demo to manage DocuSign API callbacks.

- Feature #1 - Introduced support for DocuSign API callbacks (envelope
  updates). At the moment, the feature is mostly made of sample code in the
  demo project. It shows how `django-docusign` can be used to handle DocuSign's
  API callbacks. The idea is to let users try the feature then, later, add most
  useful parts in ``django_docusign`` package.


0.2 (2014-09-16)
----------------

Introduced demo application (with tests).

- Feature #4 - Introduced demo application: illustrate and test API usage.

- Feature #3 - On signature creation, tabs can be computed by backend.


0.1 (2014-08-12)
----------------

Initial release.

- Introduced ``django_docusign.backend.DocuSignBackend`` with "create
  signature" and "post recipient view" features.
