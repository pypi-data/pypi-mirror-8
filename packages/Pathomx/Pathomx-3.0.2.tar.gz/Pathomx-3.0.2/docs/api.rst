API Reference
*************

The API reference is intended for developers of Pathomx and associated plugins. It lists
the interfaces that are available to developers to create views and behaviours. Most complex
stuff (e.g. processing thread generation) is handled by the core application and exposed as
simplified interfaces for use.

Developing a plugin? Use one of the core plugins as a starting point and use this reference
to interpret what it's doing.
