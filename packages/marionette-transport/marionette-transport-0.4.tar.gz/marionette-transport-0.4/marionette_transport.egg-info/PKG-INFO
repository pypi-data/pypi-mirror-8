Description: Marionette_ is a Mozilla project to enable remote automation in Gecko-based
        projects, including desktop Firefox, mobile Firefox, and Firefox OS. It is
        inspired by `Selenium Webdriver`_.
        
        This package defines the transport layer used by a Marionette client to
        communicate with the Marionette server embedded in Gecko.  It has no entry
        points; rather it's designed to be used by a Marionette client implementation.
