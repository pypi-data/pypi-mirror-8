    There's an important concept to understand before working with allocations.
    The resource uuid of an alloction is not always pointing to the actual
    resource.

    A resource may in fact be a real resource, or an imaginary resource with
    a uuid derived from the real resource. This is a somewhat historical
    artifact.

    If you need to know which allocations belong to a real resource, the
    mirror_of field is what's relevant. The originally created allocation
    with the real_resource is also called the master-allocation and it is
    the one allocation with mirror_of and resource being equal.

    When in doubt look at the managed_* functions of seantis.reservation.db's
    Scheduler class.
