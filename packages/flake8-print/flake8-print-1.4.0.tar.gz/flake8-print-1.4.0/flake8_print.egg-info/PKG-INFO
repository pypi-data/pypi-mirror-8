Description: Flake8 print plugin
        ==================
        
        Check for Print statements in python files. Currently does not support noqa comments.
        
        This module provides a plugin for ``flake8``, the Python code checker.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install or upgrade ``flake8-print`` with these commands::
        
          $ pip install flake8-print
          $ pip install --upgrade flake8-print
        
        
        Plugin for Flake8
        -----------------
        
        When both ``flake8 2.2`` and ``flake8-print`` are installed, the plugin is
        available in ``flake8``::
        
            $ flake8 --version
            2.0 (pep8: 1.4.5, flake8-print: 1.0, pyflakes: 0.6.1)
        
        Stdin
        -----
        
        Testing with `flake8==2.2.1`, unsure why it isn't working with newer versions.
