============
Installation
============

There is only one dependency for Vondrak, `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_. You can install with ``pip install numpy``. You can install Vondrak as well with the standard Python package tool

    ``pip install vondrak``

If you have any problems with installation, or would like to suggest an improvement, simply create an issue on the project's Github page:

Cheers!
