   :synopsis: Secure IMAP4 and SMTP connections.

.. moduleauthor:: Thomas Tanner <tanner@gmx.net>

Secure E-Mail transport does not only involve encryption of the E-Mail contents
but also of the metadata (sender, receiver), and prevention of man in the middle attacks,
which could, for example, lead to deliberate loss of E-Mails.
Ideally, all connections from sender MUA -> sender MTA -> receiver MTA/IMAP4 Server -> receiver MUA
should be properly encrypted.

This module provides extensions to the Python standard IMAP4 and SMTP classes to support
- full access to SSL parameters
- X.509 certificate based login to the servers
- login only to servers with a valid certificate
