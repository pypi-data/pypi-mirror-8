Description: This is a class that tries to limit the number of multiple simultaneous executions of a python script, on a local computer. It works by creating folders (using a pattern) under a folder. If the folder is successfully created, the execution gains the lock. Otherwise the script waits up to a configurable time to try to create the folder.
        
        Example:
        
        from lockdir import LockDir
        lock = lockdir.LockDir(parallelruns=5, secondswait=300, lockdir="/tmp/lockdir.lock")
        if not lock.acquire_lock():
            print "Error acquiring lock"
            sys.exit(1)
        # do the job
        lock.clean_lock()
