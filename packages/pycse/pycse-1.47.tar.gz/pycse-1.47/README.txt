This git repository hosts my notes on using python in scientific and engineering calculations. The aim is to collect examples that span the types of computation/calculations scientists and engineers typically do to demonstrate the utility of python as a computational platform in engineering education.

Most of the sections in the pycse.org file are posted at http://jkitchin.github.com. Feel free to leave comments there.

You may want to install the python library with pycse:

pip install pycse
