        Kundalini
        =========
        
        LÖVE_ is an **awesome** framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua_,
        in a very similar way with PyGame_.
        
        Kundalini intends to offer an API similar to that of LÖVE to develop
        games using PyGame.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Subclass ``kundalini.FrameManager`` and override the method::
            @abstractmethod
            def build_screen(self) -> Surface:
                pass
        
        
        It must return a ``pygame.surface.Surface``, like, for example, the
        object returned by ``pygame.display.set_mode()``.
        
        You also can override::
            def load(self) -> None:
                pass
        
        
            def draw(self) -> None:
                self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
        
        
            def handle_event(self, event:Event) -> None:
                pass
        
        
            def update(self, delta:float) -> None:
                pass
        
        
        The method ``load()`` is performed by ``init()`` call, just after
        ``pygame.init()``.
        
        The method ``draw()`` is performed every drawing loop.
        
        The method ``handle_event()`` is performed for each occuring event. It
        receives the event as parameter.
        
        The method ``update()`` is performed about 1024 times a second, and
        receives the time delta in seconds since last performing as parameter.
