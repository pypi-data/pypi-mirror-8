The Squabble in Strobl...

The Wrangle in Spangle...

The Quarrel in Sorell...

rumbleinthejungle prints humorous rhyming phrases of the form "the dispute in
Beirut", as appears in the 2009 film **[The Slammin' Salmon][1]**, itself an
homage to the historic boxing match, [The Rumble in the Jungle][2].
