PyReact
=======

PyReact is a Python wrapper around the `React <https://facebook.github.io/react/>`_ JavaScript library and `JSX <https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html>`_. 

Specifically, it provides an API to transform JSX files into JavaScript from within your Python application, as well as providing access to the latest React build.

For more information, please visit the `PyReact project on GitHub <https://github.com/facebook/react-python/>`_.
