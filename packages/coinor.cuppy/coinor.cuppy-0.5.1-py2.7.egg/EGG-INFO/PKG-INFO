Description: A collection of 'naive' implementations of basic
              cutting plane algorithms in Python. The collection contains a generator
              for Gomory Mixed Integer cuts and one for generating the most violated
              split cut using the method of Saxena and Balas.
        
              The idea is for these implementations to be as transparent as possible.
              I intend them mainly for educational use. They will most certainly not
              be effective in a real-world environment. Even on small examples, it is
              easy to run into numerical difficulties.
        
              The underlying solvers are Clp (https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp) and
              Cbc (https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc), which is called via the Python
              bindings of CyLP (https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP). Through CyLP, one
              can easily add these as cut generators within Cbc.
        
              The cutting plane procedure can be visualized for 2D examples using the
              polyhedron2D class of GrUMPy (https://github.com/coin-or/GrUMPy).
