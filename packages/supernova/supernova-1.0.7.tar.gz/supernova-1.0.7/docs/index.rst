supernova
=======================

**supernova helps you use novaclient (and other executables) with multiple environments the easy way.**

You may like supernova if you regularly have the following problems:

* You hate trying to source multiple novarc files when using nova
* You get your terminals confused and do the wrong things in the wrong nova environment
* You don't like remembering things
* You want to keep sensitive API keys and passwords out of plain text configuration files (see the :ref:`keyring` section)
* You need to share common skeleton environment variables for nova with your teams

If any of these complaints ring true, **supernova is for you**. supernova manages multiple nova environments without sourcing novarc files or mucking with environment variables.
