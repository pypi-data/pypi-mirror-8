Listing available supernova environments
========================================

There's a convenience function provided that will dump out your parsed supernova configuration file to the screen:::

    supernova -l

This is a good way to test your configuration file syntax and diagnose problems.  Keep in mind that any plain text credentials will be displayed on screen when you list environments (see :doc:`keyring` for more details).

If you're still using plain text credentials, now is a good time to stop using them. :)
