PyParser is a simple library that makes it easier to parse files.  I wrote it
when I needed to parse a ton of string output and files, and got very tired of
writing stuff like the following

    data = {}

    for line in output:
        line = line.strip()

        if not ':' in line:
            continue

        key, value = line.split(':', 1)
        data[key] = value
