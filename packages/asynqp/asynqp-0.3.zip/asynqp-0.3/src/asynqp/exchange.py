    Manage AMQP Exchanges and publish messages.

    An exchange is a 'routing node' to which messages can be published.
    When a message is published to an exchange, the exchange determines which :class:`Queue`
    to deliver the message to by inspecting the message's routing key and the exchange's bindings.
    You can bind a queue to an exchange, to start receiving messages on the queue,
    using :meth:`Queue.bind`.

    Exchanges are created using :meth:`Channel.declare_exchange() <Channel.declare_exchange>`.

        the name of the exchange.

        the type of the exchange (usually one of ``'fanout'``, ``'direct'``, ``'topic'``, or ``'headers'``).
