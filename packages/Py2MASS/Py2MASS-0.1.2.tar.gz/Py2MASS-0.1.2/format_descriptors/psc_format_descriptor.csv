18,ph_qual,%3s,---,no,"Photometric quality flag. Three character flag, one character per band [JHKs], that provides a summary of the net quality of the default photometry in each band, as derived from the Read Flag (rd_flg), measurement uncertainties ([jhk]_cmsig), scan signal-to-noise ratios ([jhk]_snr), frame-detection statistics (ndet), and profile-fit reduced chi-squared values ([jhk]_psfchi). The value for ph_qual is set for a band according to the precedence of the table below. For example, a source that is tested and meets the conditions for category ""X"" is not tested for subsequent qualities. 	•	""X"" - There is a detection at this location, but no valid brightness estimate can be extracted using any algorithm. rd_flg=""9"" and default magnitude is null.
	•	""U"" - Upper limit on magnitude. Source is not detected in this band (rd_flg=""0""), or it is detected, but not resolved in a consistent fashion with other bands (rd_flg=""6""). A value of ph_qual=""U"" does not necessarily mean that there is no flux detected in this band at the location. Whether or not flux has been detected can be determined from the value of rd_flg. When rd_flg=""0"", no flux has been detected. When rd_flg=""6"", flux has been detected at the location where the images were not deblended consistently in all three bands (JHKs).
	•	""F"" - This category includes rd_flg=""1"" or rd_flg=""3"" sources where a reliable estimate of the photometric error, [jhk]_cmsig, could not be determined. The uncertainties reported for these sources in [jhk]_cmsig and [jhk]_msigcom are flags and have numeric values >8.0.
	•	""E"" - This category includes detections where the goodness-of-fit quality of the profile-fit photometry was very poor (rd_flg=2 and [jhk]psf_chi>10.0), or detections where psf fit photometry did not converge and an aperture magnitude is reported (rd_flg=4), or detections where the number of frames was too small in relation to the number of frames in which a detection was geometrically possible (rd_flg=""1"" or rd_flg=""2"").
	•	""A"" - Detections in any brightness regime where valid measurements were made (rd_flg=""1"",""2"" or ""3"") with [jhk]_snr>10 AND [jhk]_cmsig<0.10857.
	•	""B"" - Detections in any brightness regime where valid measurements were made (rd_flg=""1"",""2"" or ""3"") with [jhk]_snr>7 AND [jhk]_cmsig<0.15510.

19,rd_flg,%3s,---,no,"Read flag. Three character flag, one character per band [JHKs], that indicates the origin of the default magnitudes and uncertainties in each band (j_m,h_m,k_m, j_cmsig, h_cmsig, k_cmsig). Rd_flg values of ""1"", ""2"" or ""3"" generally indicate the best quality detections, photometry and astrometry (although other quality flags must be considered). Values of ""0"", ""4"", ""6"" and ""9"" in a band indicate either non-detections, or generally poor quality photometry and positions. The definitions of the rd_flg values are: 	•	""0"" - Source is not detected in this band. The default magnitude is the 95% confidence upper limit derived from a 4"" radius aperture measurement taken at the position of the source on the Atlas Image. The sky background is estimated in an annular region with inner radius of 14"" and outer radius of 20"".
	•	""1"" - The default magnitude is derived from aperture photometry measurements on the 51 ms ""Read_1"" exposures. The aperture radius is 4"", with the sky background measured in an annulus with an inner radius of 14"" and an outer radius of 20"". Used for sources that saturate one or more of the 1.3s ""Read_2"" exposures, but are not saturated on at least one of the 51 ms ""Read_1"" frames.
	•	""2"" - The default magnitude is derived from a profile-fitting measurement made on the 1.3 sec ""Read_2"" exposures. The profile-fit magnitudes are normalized to curve-of-growth-corrected aperture magnitudes. This is the most common type in the PSC, and is used for sources that have no saturated pixels in any of the 1.3 sec exposures.
	•	""3"" - The default magnitude is derived from a 1-d radial profile fitting measurement made on the 51 ms ""Read_1"" exposures. Used for very bright sources that saturate all of the 51 ms ""Read 1"" exposures.
	•	""4"" - The default magnitude is derived from curve-of-growth-corrected 4"" radius aperture photometry measurements on the 1.3 s ""Read_2"" exposures. This is used for sources that are not saturated in any of the Read_2 frames, but where the profile-fitting measurements fail to converge to a solution. These magnitudes are the same as the standard aperture magnitudes (j_m_stdap, h_m_stdap, k_m_stdap), but when they are the default magnitudes, it generally implies that they are low quality measurements.
	•	""6"" - The default magnitude is the 95% confidence upper limit derived from a 4"" radius aperture measurement taken at the position of the source on the Atlas Image. The sky background is estimated in an annular region with inner radius of 14"" and outer radius of 20"". This is used for pairs of sources which are detected and resolved in another band, but are detected and not resolved in this band. This differs from a rd_flg=""0"" because in this case there is a detection of the source in this band, but it is not consistently resolved across all bands.
	•	""9"" - The default magnitude is the 95% confidence upper limit derived from a 4"" radius aperture measurement taken at the position of the source on the Atlas Image. The sky background is estimated in an annular region with inner radius of 14"" and outer radius of 20"". This is used for sources that were nominally detected in this band, but which could not have a useful brightness measurement from either profile fitting or aperture photometry. This often occurs in highly confused regions, or very near Tile edges where a significant fraction of the measurement aperture of sky annulus falls off the focal plane."
20,bl_flg,%3s,---,no,"Blend flag. Three character flag, one character per band [JHKs], that indicates the number of components that were fit simultaneously when estimating the brightness of a source: 
 	•	""0"" - Source is not detected, or is inconsistently deblended in that band.
	•	""1"" - One component was fit to the source in R_2 profile-fitting photometry (rd_flg=""2""), or default magnitudes are from aperture photometry (rd_flg=""1"" or ""4"") or saturated star 1-d radial profile-fitting (rd_flg=""3"").
	•	"">1"" - More than one component was fit simultaneously during R2 profile-fit photometry, where the value of the field is the number of components simultaneously fit. The maximum number of components is 7 in any band for the PSC, so this bl_flg is always a three character flag. Multi-component fitting occurs only for profile-fitting, and only when more than one detection is found within ~5"". Single detections that are not well-fit by a single PSF are not split."
21,cc_flg,%3s,---,no,"Contamination and confusion flag. Three character flag, one character per band [JHKs], that indicates that the photometry and/or position measurements of a source may be contaminated or biased due to proximity to an image artifact or nearby source of equal or greater brightness. The cc_flg in each band is set in hierarchical order according to the following table, in the event a source is affected by more than one artifact or condition:
 	•	""p"" = Persistence. Source may be contaminated by a latent image left by a nearby bright star.
	•	""c"" = Photometric Confusion. Source photometry is biased by a nearby star that has contaminated the background estimation. This is very common in high source density regions.
	•	""d"" = Diffraction spike confusion. Source may be contaminated by a diffraction spike from a nearby star.
	•	""s"" = Electronic stripe. Source measurement may be contaminated by a stripe from a nearby bright star.
	•	""b"" = Bandmerge confusion. In the process of merging detections in the different bands for this source, there was more than one possible match between the different band components. This occurs in regions of very high source density, or when multiple sources were split in one band but not another.
	•	""0"" = Source is unaffected by known artifacts, or is not detected in the band. Non-zero values the cc_flg in any band is an indicator that the measurements of that source may be contaminated."
22,ndet,%6s,---,no,"Frame detection statistics. A six-character flag, two characters per band [JJHHKsKs], that indicates the number frames on which a source was detected, N, and the number of frames on which the source could have been measured, M. The first digit in the pair for each band, N, gives the number of frames on which there were >3 sigma aperture photometry detections of the source. The second digit for each band, M, gives the number of frames on which aperture measurements were possible. Normally, M=6, (occasionally M=7 because the scanning step size was slightly less than 1/6 of the frame size). M can be <6 if frames are ""lost"" because: a) there were masked pixels within the source aperture due to cosmic ray detections, noisy pixels, meteor trails, etc, or b) there were saturated pixels within the source aperture. Values of M < 6 are not uncommon, but do indicate an effective loss of coverage and sensitivity for a source.
The values of N and M for a band always pertain to the aperture photometry on the 51 ms ""Read_1"" exposures if rd_flg=""1"", and to the aperture photometry on the 1.3 s ""Read_2"" exposures if rd_flg=""2"" or ""4"". Sources that are saturated on all of the Read_1 frames (rd_flg=""3"") have N=0 because no aperture photometry was possible.
Sources with signal-to-noise ratios >8-9 should be detected on all available frames. Values of N < M for such sources are an indication of possible loss of measurement integrity. Values of N < M, or even N=0, are normal for fainter sources because they are too faint on individual frames to yield a >3 sigma detection."
23,prox,%5.1f,arcsec,no,"Proximity. The distance between this source and its nearest neighbor in the PSC. The pts_key of the nearest source is given in the pxcntr column. The effective resolution of the 2MASS system is approximately 5"". Any source with prox < 6"" is potentially confused with a nearby object, and should be used with caution."
24,pxpa,%3d,deg,yes,"The position angle on the sky of the vector from the source to the nearest neighbor in the PSC, in degrees East of North. This column in null if prox=0.0, which occurs only for confused sources or from errors in the bandmerge process caused by confusion."
25,pxcntr,%10d,---,no,The pts_key value of the nearest source in the PSC.
26,gal_contam,%1d,---,no,"Extended source ""contamination"" flag. A value of gal_contam=""2"" indicates that this point source falls within the elliptical boundary of an XSC source defined by the semi-major axis and ellipticity of the 20 mag arcsec-2 Ks-band elliptical isophote (r_k20fe) +10%, for XSC sources where r_k20fe is >10''. Sources so indicated are often foreground stars superimposed on background galaxies, or sometimes extractions of pieces of the galaxy or nebula. The point source photometry for these sources is probably contaminated by the surrounding structured extended emission. Point sources can still be superimposed on extended sources and remain unflagged if the XSC source shape is not well-described by an ellipse.
This flag also denotes (gal_contam=""1"") PSC sources that are equivalent to sources in the XSC, but only for XSC sources with r_k20fe is >10''. Since most XSC sources have semi-major axes <10'', gal_contam does not identify all PSC sources with exact XSC counterparts. Use the ext_key to identify all PSC sources that were found to be resolved relative to a single point-spread function.. 	•	""0"" - Source does not fall within the elliptical profile of an extended source with semi-major axis >10'', or it is not identified exactly with an XSC source with semi-major axis >10''. However, the source may correspond exactly to a smaller XSC source.
	•	""1"" - Source is resolved by 2MASS, and is equivalent to a source in the XSC that has a semi-major axis >10'' in size. Users must refer to the ext_key to identify all PSC sources with XSC counterparts.
	•	""2"" - Source falls within the elliptical boundary of an XSC source that has a semi-major axis >10'' in size."
27,mp_flg,%1d,---,no,"Minor Planet Flag. Indicates if this source is associated with the predicted position of a known minor planet, comet, planet or planetary satellite. This association does not guarantee that the PSC source is a detection of the solar system object. 
 	•	""0"" - Source is not associated with a known solar system object
	•	""1"" - Source is associated with the predicted position of a known solar system object. The name and orbital data for the associated objects are given in the Known Asteroid Detection List, Known Comet Detection List, and Planet and Planetary Satellite Detection List. The associated PSC source is cross-referenced in those Lists via the value of pts_key 	◦	"
28,pts_key/cntr,%10d,---,no,"A unique identification number for the PSC source. This column is called pts_key in the DVD and ftp versions of the PSC and cntr in the IRSA/GATOR version. This sequential number was defined when source records from final data processing were loaded into the Point Source Working Database. Pts_key is incremented in order (or reverse order depending on the scan direction) of declination within a scan. For this reason, on average sources with close pts_key values are close to each other on the sky, except at Tile boundaries. Pts_key ordering thus provides a useful mapping of the 2MASS release on storage media. PSC sources are cross-referenced in the XSC, Known Asteroid Detection List, Known Comet Detection List, and Planet and Planetary Satellite Detection List via the value of pts_key."

34,x_scan,%6.1f,arcsec,no,"Mean cross-scan focal plane position of the source in the Universal scan (U-scan) coordinate system. This is the approximate distance a source lies west or east of the focal plane centerline. Positive values of x_scan indicate that the source falls west of the centerline and negative values indicate the source is east of the centerline. The focal plane position is approximate because it is derived from the mean position of the source detected on up to seven different frames and three different bands. The U-scan coordinate system combines the pixels from the three arrays from each camera, and follows the near-great-circle path of the scan across the sky. The x_scan value is useful for identifying sources that may be caused or affected by hot pixel events."

41,h_m_stdap,%6.3f,mag,yes,"H-band ""standard"" aperture magnitude. This is the curve-of-growth corrected average brightness measured in a 4"" radius aperture centered on the source position on each of the available 1.3 s ""Read_2"" frames. The background sky reference on each frame is measured in an annular region with inner radius of 14"" and outer radius of 20"". Non-detections on individual frames are included in the average so that the flux is not statistically overestimated. The curve-of-growth correction adjusts to an ""infinite"" aperture using a normalization value derived from a series of multi-aperture measurements made from many stars having the same seeing FWHM as the source that is corrected. The amplitude of the correction is tabulated in the h_ap_cor value in the Atlas Image Data Table (NOT YET AVAILABLE).
This column can contain a measurement even if the default magnitude is from the 51 ms ""Read_1"" exposures (rd_flg=""1""). In this case, the value is the aperture measurement from the available non-saturated 1.3 s ""Read_2"" exposures.

	•	"">1"" = The source falls within a Tile overlap region, and there are multiple sources detected within 2"" of its position in the overlapping Tile, and/or within its own Tile. This implies confusion in the multiple source resolution procedure."
49,use_src,%1d,---,no,"Use source flag. Used in conjunction with the dup_src flag, this numerical flag indicates if a source falls within a Tile overlap region, and whether or not it satisfies the unbiased selection rules for multiple source resolution.
 	•	""1"" = The source does not fall in a Tile overlap region (dup_src=""0""), or it falls in an overlap region, but lies farther from its scan edge than any apparition of the source in another Tile. A source must have use_src=""1"" to be considered part of the sub-Catalog that satisfies the 2MASS Level 1 Science Requirements
	•	""0"" = The source falls in a Tile overlap region, but does not have a detection within 2"" of its position in any overlapping Tiles. PSC sources with use_src=""0"" will always have dup_src=""0"".

	•	""U"" = USNO-A2.0 catalog source positionally associated with 2MASS source Positional association between the 2MASS PSC source and an optical catalog source does not guarantee an identification. Users should consider the separation between the sources, the number of possible optical matches, and consider proper motion when assessing optical counterparts to 2MASS sources.
The optical association information is unreliable for sources with |dec|>86° because of an error in the 2MASS/USNO-A2.0 position correlation procedure that caused associations to be missed in the vicinity of the equatorial poles.
