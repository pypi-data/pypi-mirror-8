2,designation,S,17s,-,"Source designation formed from sexigesimal coordinates.
This is the object sequence designation, or object ""name"" as specified by the IAU recommendations on source nomenclature. It is derived from the J2000 sexigesimal coordinates of the source and has the form HHMMSSSS+/-DDMMSSS, where HH are the hours of right ascension, MM the RA minutes and SSS are the deci-seconds of RA. DD are the degrees in declination, MM are DEC minutes and SS the declination seconds. Note that both the RA deci-seconds of time and DEC seconds of arc are truncated rather than rounded, per the IAU recommendation. The full naming convention for 2MASS All-Sky Release sources has the form ""2MASX Jhhmmssss+ddmmsss[ABC...]"", where ""2MASX"" indicates that the source is from the All-Sky XSC, ""J"" indicates the position is J2000, and the optional trailing letters are used to distinguish sources with otherwise duplicate names. The ""2MASX J"" prefix is not listed explicitly in the designation column."
