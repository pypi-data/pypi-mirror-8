def viterbi_decoding(emission, transition,
                     initial=None, consecutive=None, force=None):
    """Viterbi decoding

    Parameters
    ----------
    emission : array of shape (n_samples, n_states)
        E[t, i] is the emission log-probabilities of sample t at state i.
    transition : array of shape (n_states, n_states)
        T[i, j] is the transition log-probabilities from state i to state j.
    initial : optional, array of shape (n_states, )
        I[i] is the initial log-probabilities of state i.
    consecutive : optional, int or int array of shape (n_states, )
        C[i] is a the minimum-consecutive-states constraint for state i.
        C[i] = 1 is equivalent to no constraint.
    force : optional, array of shape (n_samples, )
        F[t] = i forces sample t to be in state i.
        Use F[t] = -1 for no constraint.

    Returns
    -------
    states : array of shape (n_samples, )
        Most probable state sequence
