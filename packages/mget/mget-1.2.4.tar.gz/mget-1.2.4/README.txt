Apparently Some site requires some clearance before downloading, So please point the url to browser and export the cookie-file use that file to pass the clearance

### I have downloaded a video but how can I play it?

Once the video is fully downloaded, use any video player, such as [vlc](http://www.videolan.org) or [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/).

## Read Source ##

MGet is packed as an executable zipfile, simply unzip it (might need renaming to `mget.zip` first on some systems). If you modify the code, you can run it by executing the `__main__.py` file. To recompile the executable, run `./install.sh`.
