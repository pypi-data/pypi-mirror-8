Description: asyncoro is a Python framework for concurrent and/or distributed
        and/or network programming with asynchronous completions and
        coroutines. Asynchronous completions implemented in asyncoro are
        socket I/O operations (non-blocking sockets), database cursors, sleep
        timers and locking primitives. Programs developed with asyncoro have
        same logic and structure as Python programs with threads, except for a
        few syntactic changes. asyncoro supports socket I/O notification
        mechanisms epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll (and poll and select, where
        necessary), and Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) for high
        performance and scalability, and SSL for security. asyncoro features
        include remote execution of coroutines, coroutines monitoring other
        coroutines, coroutines communicating with messages, message channels
        etc., for concurrent, distributed, fault-tolerant programming.
        
        asyncoro.py is to be used with Python version 2.7+ and asyncoro3.py is
        to be used with Python version 3.1+. asyncoro has been tested with
        Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. asyncoro is implemented with standard
        modules in Python. Under Windows efficient polling notifier I/O
        Completion Ports is supported only if pywin32
        (http://pywin32.sourceforge.net) is installed; otherwise, inefficient
        'select' notifier is used.
        
        See http://asyncoro.sourceforge.net for more details.
