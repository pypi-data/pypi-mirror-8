Description: Poser Box
        ---------
        
        Poser Box helps starting and stopping a sandboxed Poser instance
        from within a Python process. The Poser instance will choose a free port on
        localhost.
        It is primarily expected to be used in tests.
        
        A typical use of a Poser Box:
        
        ```python
        import requests
        from poserbox import PoserBox
        
        box = PoserBox(scenes_file="test.yaml", proxy="http://example.com")
        box.record()
        real = requests.get("http://localhost:%s" % box.port)
        box.stop()
        
        box.play()
        fake = requests.get("http://localhost:%s" % box.port)
        box.stop()
        
        assert real.content == fake.content
        
        ```
        
        Nose
        ----
        
        Poser Box comes with a Nose plugin which is automatically installed.
        If used as a plugin, port of the running instance will be exported
        in environment variable `POSERBOX_PORT`. This name can be overridden
        in settings.
        
        The plugin exposes several configuration options. To see them, run:
        
            nosetests --help
        
        The options you are interested in start with `--poserbox-`.
