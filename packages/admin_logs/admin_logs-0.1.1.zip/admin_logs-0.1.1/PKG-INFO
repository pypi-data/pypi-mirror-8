Description: About
        =====
        
        This small module for django allows you to store requests in your database(now supports only database) and then look at them in django admin.
        This module was inspired by logs in Google Application Engine
        
        
        Configure
        =========
        
        Include this lines to your settings.py:
        
        
        ::
        
          INSTALLED_APPS += ('admin_logs', )
          MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = ('admin_logs.middleware.LogRequestMiddleware', ) + MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES  # place middleware as early as possible
        
          ADMIN_LOGS_BACKEND = 'admin_logs.backends.database.DatabaseBackend'  # now supports only database
        
          from admin_logs import setup_level
          setup_level('INFO')  # set minumum log level that will be written to logs
        
        
        Working
        =======
        
        Anywhere in the code you can run:
        
        ::
        
          import logging
          logging.warning('Test')
        
        
        And this warning will be written to logs and you can check it later.
