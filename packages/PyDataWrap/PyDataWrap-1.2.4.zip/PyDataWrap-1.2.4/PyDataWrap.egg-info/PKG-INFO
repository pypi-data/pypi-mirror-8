Description: PyDataWrap
        ==========
        
        Python Wrappers on Data Structures and abstractions over persistent data
        stores.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        This module is a home for Python wrappers of data, databases and
        datastructures. It defines common use wrapping that can treat one style
        of data as another or reorder/subselect a collection.
        
        The filedbwrap file defines many file based database objects such as
        dictionaries and sets which are treated as memory objects in Python but
        have a very large capacity with limited memory footprint.
        
        The savable file defines object persistence objects which save state
        when they deconstruct and reload that state upon initialization.
        
        The listwrap file defines a no-copy list subset selector that can
        retrieve subsets of data to be treated as complete, contiguous lists.
        
        There are also some file loading/saving modules for various formats.
