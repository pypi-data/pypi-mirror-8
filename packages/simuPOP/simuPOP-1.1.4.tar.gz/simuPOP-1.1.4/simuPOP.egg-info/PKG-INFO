Description: 
        simuPOP is a forward-time population genetics simulation environment.
        The core of simuPOP is a scripting language (Python) that provides 
        a large number of objects and functions to manipulate populations, 
        and a mechanism to evolve populations forward in time. Using this 
        R/Splus-like environment, users can create, manipulate and evolve 
        populations interactively, or write a script and run it as a batch 
        file. Owing to its flexible and extensible design, simuPOP can simulate
        large and complex evolutionary processes with ease. At a more 
        user-friendly level, simuPOP provides an increasing number of built-in
        scripts that perform simulations ranging from implementation of basic 
        population genetics models to generating datasets under complex 
        evolutionary scenarios.
