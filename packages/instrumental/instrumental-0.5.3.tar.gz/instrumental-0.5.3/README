Running Instrumental
====================

There isn't much to it, actually. Install it. If you're reading this then 
you've gotten the source. A simple 'python setup.py install' or 'python 
setup.py develop' will get you started.

Most of the time, you'll want to invoke intrumental something like this:

instrumental -r -s -a -t somename somepythonscript

That says, "Please run the script 'somepythonscript', instrumenting any 
module who's full dotted name starts with 'somename'. When you're done, 
please show me a report containing coverage percentages as well as a summary 
of all of the constructs you instrumented and the coverage results for those 
constructs".
