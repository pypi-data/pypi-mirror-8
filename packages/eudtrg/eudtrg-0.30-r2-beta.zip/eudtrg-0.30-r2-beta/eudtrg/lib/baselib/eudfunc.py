def EUDFunc(fdecl_func):
    '''
    Generates EUD Function. Usually used as decorators. EUD Function shouldn't
    be applied to recursive functions. ::

        @EUDFunc
        def f_add(a, b):
            ret = EUDCreateVariables(1)
            SeqCompute([
                (ret, SetTo, 0),
                (ret, Add, a),
                (ret, Add, b)
            ])

            return ret

    EUD function gets several EUDVariables as arguments, but user can use both
    :class:`EUDVariable` and :class:`Expr` for calling function. ::

        a,b = EUDCreateVariable(2)
        c = Trigger()
        d = c_int

        f_mul(a,b) # ok
        f_mul(10, b) # ok. 10 can be implicitly converted to Expr.
        f_mul(10, 20) # ok.
        f_mul(a, c) # ok. Trigger is type of expression. In this case, address
            # of trigger will be passed to f_mul.
        f_mul(a, d) # Error. c_int is neither EUDVariable nor Expr.

    EUD Function may return several return values. Return values are
    overwritten after every function call, so users should store it with
    :func:`SetVariables` or :func:`SeqCompute` if they need it. ::

        SeqCompute(local_variable, f_function()) # store return value

        f_function() # local_variable still presists its value.

    If returned values won't be used after another function call, users don't
    have to store it. ::

        var = f_function()

        f_function() # var is overwritten now.


    :param fdecl_func: Function to be converted into EUD function.
        fdecl_func recieves several EUDVariable and should return single/list
        of EUDVariable.
