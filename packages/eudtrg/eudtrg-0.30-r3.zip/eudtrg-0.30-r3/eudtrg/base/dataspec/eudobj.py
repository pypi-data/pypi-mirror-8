    Base class for uploadable objects. Uploadable objects objects having data
    to be inserted into SC Memory. Every EUDObject corresponds to one memory
    chunk inside SC Memory. EUDObject creates data to put inside memory chunk.

    For example, every trigger in Starcraft is just a 2408byte memory chunk.
    :class:`eudtrg.Trigger` refers to that memory chunk, and can create 2408
    byte data to put inside it.
