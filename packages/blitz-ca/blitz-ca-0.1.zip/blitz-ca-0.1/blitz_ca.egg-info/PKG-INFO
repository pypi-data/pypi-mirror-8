Description: Blitz CA
        ========
        A tool for managing the signing and generation of CSRs as well as the creation of certificate Authorities
        
        Features
        ---------
        * Its not the openssl command
        * Sane flags
        * Its not the openssl command
        * internal API to leverage in your own apps
        * Its not the openssl command
        * Single File Certificate store based off sqlite makes backups easy
        * Human readable times that become more accurate as the appointed time gets closer
          eg '3 days from now' to '3 hours from now' to '03:14'
        * Ability to add comments to certificates, keys and requests
        * Generate CRLs'
        * Webserver to provision new certificates to bearers of a valid (but soon to 
          expire) certificate allowing automatic update of certificates via a cronjob
        
        Installation
        -------------
        To create a virtual environment use the following commands
        
            pyvenv-3.4 --system-site-packages venv
            . bin/venv/activate
            pip install blitz-ca
        
        to activate the environment in another terminal repeat the activate step as shown below
        
            . bin/venv/activate
        
        as this is an argparse based program, comprehensive help is available by specifying '-h' or '--help'
        to receive help on a sub command, use '-h' as above after the sub command itself
        
        At this time there is no other documentation avalible but those who have 
        created certificates and CSRs with the openssl command should be fammilar 
        enough with the terminolgy and process to use the program.
        
        What Works
        -----------
        * Key Generation
        * Cert Generation
        * Request Generation
        * Request Signing
        * Arbitrary x509 extensions
        * Subject alternative names
        * Key usage
        * RSA and DSA keys of arbitrary bit length
        
        What does not Work
        -------------------
        * Tracking of issued certs
        * CRL Generation
        * Auto Enrolment webserver
        * Confirmation before signing a request
        * Elliptic Curve keys
        
        Notes
        ------
        * If you do not specify a key then one will be created for you automaticly as 
          part of the CSR or certificate generation. if you are having trouble matching a 
          CSR up to a private key at generation time, consider using the '-C' flag to add 
          a comment to both the private key and CSR
          
        * Signing a request will copy extensions from the request into the certificate
          however there is currently no way to audit the request before signing and approve 
          extensions
        
        * Certificates are backdated by 1 hour to help prevent issues with clients/servers 
          with clock drift (if you have 1 hour of clock drift you ahve bigger issues but
          daylight savigns may cause issues)
