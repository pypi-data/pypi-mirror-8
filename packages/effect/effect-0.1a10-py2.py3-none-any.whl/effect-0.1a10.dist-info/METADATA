Effect is a library for helping you write purely functional code by
isolating the effects (that is, IO or state manipulation) in your code.

You can `read the core module`_, it's pretty short.

Status: Alpha
=============

Right now Effect is in alpha, and is likely to change incompatibly. Once it's
being used in production, I'll release a final version.


What Is It?
===========

It's a number of things, depending on your perspective:

- the IO monad for Python, or
- an immutable/purely functional version of Twisted's Deferred, or
- a way to improve test quality, by promoting "stub" objects to the real
  implementation
- a way to decouple the "intent" of an effect from the implementation, thus
  allowing alternative implementations of effects.

Each of these perspectives has a section below describing that approach.

Effect starts with a very simple idea: instead of having a function which
performs side-effects (such as IO):


.. code:: python

    def get_user_name():
        return raw_input("Enter User Name> ")

you instead have a function which *returns* a representation of the
side-effect:

.. code:: python

    def get_user_name():
        return Effect(ReadLine("Enter User Name> "))

We call objects like "ReadLine" an *intent* -- that is, the *intent* of this
effect is to read a line.

This function now returns an object which can later be "performed":

.. code:: python

    def main():
        effect = get_user_name()
        effect = effect.on(success=print)
        perform(effect)

This has a number of advantages. First, your unit tests for ``get_user_name``
become simpler. You don't need to mock out or parameterize the ``raw_input``
function - you just call ``get_user_name`` and assert that it returns a ReadLine
object with the correct 'prompt' value.

Second, you can implement ReadLine in a number of different ways - it's
possible to override the implementations of effects to do whatever you want.

Third, your function is now purely functional, letting you rest easy knowing
that you've improved the amount of quality code in the world ;-)

For more information on how to implement the actual effect-performing code,
and other details, see the `API documentation`_

.. _`API documentation`: https://github.com/radix/effect/blob/master/effect/__init__.py


Callback chains
===============

Effect allows you to build up chains of callbacks that process data in turn.
That is, if you attach a callback ``a`` and then a callback ``b`` to an Effect,
``a`` will be called with the original result and ``b`` will be called with with
the result of ``a``. This is inspired directly by Twisted's Deferreds.

This is a great way to build end-to-end abstractions, compared to non-chaining
callback systems like Python's Futures. You can easily build abstractions
like the following:

.. code:: python

    def request_url(method, url, str_body):
        """Perform an HTTP request."""
        return Effect(Request(method, url, str_body))

    def request_200_url(method, url, str_body):
        """
        Perform an HTTP request, and raise an error if the response is not 200.
        """
        return request_url(method, url, str_body).on(success=check_status)

    def json_request(method, url, dict_body):
        """
        Perform an HTTP request where the body is sent as JSON and the response
        is automatically decoded as JSON if the Content-type is
        application/json.
        """
        str_body = json.dumps(dict_body)
        return request_url(method, url, str_body).on(success=decode_json)

The monadic bind function has these same properties. Those Haskell people sure
have some good ideas.


Learning more
=============

I've tried to ensure that the docstrings of all the public functions and
classes are up to snuff. There are also real-world examples available in
the `examples`_ directory, including how to write idiomatic tests.

.. _`examples`: https://github.com/radix/effect/tree/master/examples

Following are a number of sections where the utility of the Effect library is
highlighted from a number of different use cases.


IO Monad for Python
-------------------

Effects are vaguely analogus to IO monads. The Effect class can be compared
to the IO type, which tags (or wraps) your result type, and
``Effect.on`` is somewhat like the bind function (``>>=``), indicating
that the function passed is to be called with the result of the effect.
Haskell's ``Either`` can be thrown in to handle ``.on(success=...)`` vs
``.on(error=...)``.

But Effect is a little more than just the IO monad, since Effects make
available the intent as *transparent data*. By transparent, I specifically
mean that it should be an inert data structure with public attributes
describing everything necessary to perform the effect. In Haskell, a function
that returns ``IO a`` can only be returned up to main and performed -- there is
no way to introspect what the function wants to do (for, e.g., testing
purposes).

Representing effects as transparent data gives us two advantages:

- the ability to provide alternative implementations (such as an asynchronous
  Twisted-based implementation, or a standard blocking implementation), since
  the effect performance is late-bound to the effect intent.
- the ability to perform simple value comparisons in your unit tests to ensure
  the right effects will be performed.

Of course these use cases have also been solved in Haskell. Quite interesting
is the recent work being done with free monads, and the idea of "parsing", or
more accurately interpreting, effect-relying code written in a domain-specific
language in a way so as to not actually perform those effects. For more
information on this work, see:

http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/242795/what-is-the-free-monad-interpreter-pattern

http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-language-and-its-interpretation.html

https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/4429-simon-marlow

To say the least, this would be difficult to fit into Python.

Immutable Deferreds
-------------------

There are two main differences between Effects and Deferreds, and one is only
conventional. One, of course, is that Effects are immutable. The second is that
the functions that *produce* Effects are (or *can* be) pure.

In almost every case, Deferred-producing functions must have side effects.
They kick off some IO and tuck the Deferred away somewhere so they can fire
it later.

Functions that produce Effects, on the other hand, should not have
side-effects. They should simply describe the *intent* of the effect. They
don't need to tuck the Effect away to fire later, because that whole process
comes later, when the effect is performed.

In some sense, an Effect is an inside-out Deferred -- instead of performing
the effects in the innermost function that produces the Deferred, with
callbacks being attached on the way out, the effect is performed after the
whole tree of callbacks has been constructed, higher up the stack.

This avoids the problems with Deferred that require it to have a special
garbage-collection handler to log errors that haven't yet been handled --
we know that when all of an Effect's callbacks have been run, no more can
possibly be attached, so we can immediately raise an exception if the final
result was an error (this is the behavior of the ``sync_perform`` function).


Testability by promoting stub objects
-------------------------------------

In unit tests, we often use stub objects to replace objects that are
considered "expensive", or otherwise difficult to deal with. The Effect
library encourages the promotion of these stub objects to the implementation.
This allows us to stop worrying if our stub is close enough to the real thing,
since it *is* the real thing -- if the stub is wrong, the effect implementation wouldn't work.


Alternative effect implementations
----------------------------------

Effect is a good way to write code that can be used in any number of IO
frameworks: either with standard blocking IO, or with an asynchronous IO
system like Twisted or asyncio (or Trollius, or Tornado, or eventlet, etc
etc). This is because it forces you to decouple the plain, pure functions that
perform only the work *between* IO from the IO work itself.


A history of the development
----------------------------

For pedagogical purposes, I'll describe the thought process that led me to
write this library. There were a couple of desires that led to me thinking
about this problem.

First, I had been thinking for a long time that more of my code should be
purely functional. The benefits of pure FP code are well understood, if not
fully accepted by the majority of programmers. Needless to say, I buy into
it.

I long had the idea that an HTTP client library, for example, should separate
the request from the performance of that request. My ideal client would return
an inert "Request" object from the http.get() method, instead of actually
performing the IO.

At the same time, I had also been struggling with testing in the Python
ecosystem. Mocking and stubbing have become extremely widespread in the
community, but over and over I saw that the result of ubiquitous usage of
mocking were test suites that were extremely difficult to understand and
maintain. I saw test suites that were overly tied to the implementation of
code under test, and much duplicated mock boilerplate -- code that would
set up detailed mocks that were very subtly different from test to test.

For a while, I thought that "verified fakes" would solve the problem. Instead
of having every one of your tests mocking out the specific IO methods that a
piece of implementation code will use, write a class that implements the same
interface as the IO code and acts on a test model. This is a good way to do it,
but then you have to concern yourself with ensuring the fake has the same
behavior as the real implementation.

Then I realized that stubs were a lot like my idea for the "Request" object
that my ideal HTTP client library would return -- in other words, the stubs
could be promoted to being used in the real implementation. That way the
majority of my tests wouldn't need any mocking or stubbing, and would just
invoke the pure 'get' method and ensure that it returned a Request object that
looked right.

Once I got serious about writing code that was purely functional and which
returned transparent objects I quickly came to the conclusion that *just*
returning a Request object wasn't enough. I realized I needed *end to end
abstractions*. Specifically, for example, I wanted an HTTP client abstraction
that could specify a request *and* process the result -- by checking to see
if the response code was something other than 200 and raising an error, for
example. Or automatically decoding JSON responses to Python objects.

Basically, I needed callbacks, or the ``>>=`` operator from Haskell. Deferreds
are a great abstraction for callbacks, but I wanted something purely
functional, and which let you decouple the intent of the effect from the
performance of the effect. From all these ideas came the Effect library.
