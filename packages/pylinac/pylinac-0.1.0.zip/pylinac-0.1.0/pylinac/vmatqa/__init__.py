"""The VMAT module consists of the class VMAT, which is capable of loading an Open field image and MLC field image and analyzing the
images according to the Jorgensen et al. tests, specifically the dose-rate & gantry-speed (DRGS) and MLC speed (MLCS) tests. The picket
fence tests are analyzed in another module.
