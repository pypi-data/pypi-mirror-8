Description: ircpdb - Remotely debug your Python application from an IRC channel
        ===================================================================
        
        Ircpdb is an adaptation of rpdb that, instead of opening a port and
        allowing you to debug over telnet, connects to a configurable IRC
        channel so you can collaboratively debug an application remotely.
        
        .. code-block::
        
            import ircpdb
            ircpdb.set_trace(
                channel="#debugger_hangout",
            )
        
        By default, ircpdb will create the channel you specify on Freenode
        and randomly select a nickname for itself, but you can feel free to
        configure ircpdb to connect anywhere:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            import ircpdb
            ircpdb.set_trace(
                channel="#debugger_hangout",
                nickname='im_a_debugger',
                server='irc.mycompany.org',
                limit_access_to=['mynickname'],
                port=6667,
                ssl=True,
            )
        
        Upon reaching `set_trace()`, your script will "hang" and the only way to get it
        to continue is to access ircpdb by talking to the user that connected to the
        above IRC channel.
        
        By default, the debugger will enter the channel you've specified using a
        username starting with the hostname of the computer from which it was
        launched (in the following example: 'MyHostname').  To interact with
        the debugger, just send messages in the channel prefixed with "MyHostname:",
        or simply "!".
        
        For example, the following two commands are equivalent, and each will
        display the pdb help screen (be sure to replace 'MyHostname' with whatever
        username the bot selected)::
        
            !help
        
            MyHostname: help
        
        Installation in CPython (standard Python)
        -----------------------------------------
        
            pip install ircpdb
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        If you do not see the bot entering your specified channel, try increasing
        the logging level by adding the following lines above your trace to gather
        a little more information about problems that may have occurred while 
        connecting to the IRC server:
        
        .. code-block::
        
           import logging
           logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

        ==================
        
         - Write addr/port to stderr instead of stdout (thanks to @onlynone).
         - Allow for dynamic host port (thanks to @onlynone).
         - Make q/quit do proper cleanup (@kenmanheimer)
         - Benignly disregard repeated rpdb.set_trace() to same port as currently
           active session (@kenmanheimer)
         - Extend backwards compatibility down to Python 2.5 (@kenmanheimer)
        
        0.1.4 (2014-04-28)
        ==================
        
         - Expose the addr, port arguments to the set_trace method (thanks to @niedbalski).
        
        0.1.3 (2013-08-02)
        ==================
        
         - Remove a try/finally that seemed to shift the trace location (thanks to k4ml@github).
        
        0.1.2 (2012-01-26)
        ==================
        
         - Catch IOError raised by print in initialization, it may not work in some
           environments (e.g. mod_wsgi). (Menno Smits)
