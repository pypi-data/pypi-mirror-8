Description: Syncify
        =======
        
        This package is meant for wrapping asynchronous functions so that they
        behave like synchronous functions. This package is very useful when
        scripting.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install syncify
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Suppose you have an asynchronous function called ``asyncFunction`` that
        has a keyword arguement, ``'callback'`` for the callback function. You
        can run it synchronously like this:
        
        ::
        
            from syncify import syncify
        
            results syncify(asyncFunction, kw='callback')(arguments)
        
        They keyword, ``kw`` is set to ``'callback'`` by default so that can be
        left off, but I left it there in case someone has a different callback
        keyword.
