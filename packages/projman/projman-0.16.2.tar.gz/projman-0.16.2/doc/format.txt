Description of task_file structure
----------------------------------

Root element : task
Task can be nested
Task attrs (all required): 

* id

* load-type :

   * shared : load is distributed among all resources according to
              other constraints

   * oneof : the full load will be assigned to only one of the
             resources

   * sameforall : each resource will be assigned the full load (eg. a
                  meeting)

   * spread : (not working) the resource and the load will be
              scheduled for the whole duration of the task. eg a
              manager will work alltogether 5 days during a one month
              period.
