v0.0.1, 17/02/2013 -- Initial release
v0.0.2, 17/02/2013 -- Trivial packaging problems
v0.1.0, 17/02/2013 -- Switch to more sophisticated algorithm that better run length encodes the results
v0.1.1, 18/02/2013 -- Significant improvement of behaviour in the presence of cycles of length 2.
v0.1.2, 18/02/2013 -- Improved compression of the resulting list. Make behaviour more collection like.
v0.2.0, 20/02/2013 -- Implementation no longer lazily evaluates judgement trail as they're always really short. Simplified code.
v0.3.0, 20/02/2013 -- Greatly stripped down API - just implement the basic comparison operations. Also significantly improved implementation.
v0.3.1, 13/04/2013 -- Added randomized tests to the test suite. Fixed a bug where an all-zero tally array would trigger an IndexError.
v0.3.2, 07/12/2014 -- Fix an off by one error which meant that this gave the wrong answer in some cases.
