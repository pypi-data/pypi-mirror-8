Description: ======
        icheck
        ======
        
        quick (or not so quick) and dirty tool to run syntax checking on python code 
        in a seperate screen window
        
        features
        ---------
        * Call a command on syntax failures
        * terminal bell
        * filter files by hashbang and globs
        * color output with tty detection
        * multiple output formats (oneline, short and long)
        
        
        This program was mainly written to assit me in devlopeing python code and 
        letting me know a couple of seconds before i try and run my program that there 
        are basic syntax mistakes in the code.
        
        to achive this inotify is used to wait for files to be written to and then if 
        all pre conditions are fine (globs and hashbangs) then a syntax check is 
        excuted. on an error a message is printed and it moves on to the next file
        
        By using the 'bell' facility the window running icheck does not have to be 
        visible to the programmer and isntead a message will be printed in the message 
        line on error indicating attention may be required, allowing screen to be used 
        as the windowing component of a fleixble IDE setup
