Getting a corpus
================

Confopy needs a corpus (collection of language data) to run.

For German (TIGER treebank):

Automated download:

    1. Go to 
       <your python package directory>/confopy/localization/de/corpus\_de/
    2. Execute the script
       tiger_dl_patch.py
       within that folder

Manual download:

    1. Go to: 
       http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/TIGERCorpus/license/htmlicense.html
    2. Accept the license and download TIGER-XML Release 2.2: 
       http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/TIGERCorpus/download/tigercorpus-2.2.xml.tar.gz
    3. Unpack the archive into confopy/localization/de/corpus\_de/
    4. Run the patch tiger\_release\_aug07.corrected.16012013\_patch.py in the same folder
    5. Verify that the generated file is named exactly like in confopy/config.py


Python 3
========

 * The package python-pdfminer only works with python 2.4 or newer, but not with python 3


Unicode errors
==============

 * Configure terminal to use unicode!
 * For Python devs:
    http://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html#the-unicode-type
 * Convert the TIGER Treebank file
    "tiger_release_aug07.corrected.16012013.xml"
   to utf-8 encoding before using Confopy!
