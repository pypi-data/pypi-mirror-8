The CGAT code collection has been made possible by the many developers
in the bioinformatics and python community that have made their code
available for sharing. The code collection includes some snippets of
code taken from elsewhere, most notably:

1. IGV.py from Brent Petersen 
   https://github.com/brentp/bio-playground/blob/master/igv/igv.py

2. Nested containment list from the Pygr project
   http://code.google.com/p/pygr/
