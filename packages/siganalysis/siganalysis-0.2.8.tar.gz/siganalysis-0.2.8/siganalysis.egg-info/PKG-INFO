        Python (2.7+/3.4+) routines for analyzing signals. Some of the functions
        include:
        
        -  Calculating Short-Term Fourier Transform
        -  Smoothing a signal
        -  Plotting an STFT's spectrogram
        -  Calculating the peak hold of an STFT in the freq domain
        -  Plotting the peak hold of an STFT
        
        The above functions are handy when analyzing signals recorded in the
        time domain, such as using a TEAC LX-10 data recorder, and seeing the
        frequency spectrum. This is useful for Electromagnetic Compatibility
        (EMC) analyses.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install
        `siganalysis <https://github.com/questrail/siganalysis>`__ either via
        the Python Package Index (PyPI) or from source.
        
        To install using pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install siganalysis
        
        **Source:** https://github.com/questrail/siganalysis
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        `siganalysis <https://github.com/questrail/siganalysis>`__ requires the
        following Python packages:
        
        -  `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`__
        -  `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`__
        -  `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`__
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        `siganalysis <https://github.com/questrail/siganalysis>`__ is developed
        using `Scott Chacon <http://scottchacon.com/about.html>`__'s `GitHub
        Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__. To
        contribute, fork
        `siganalysis <https://github.com/questrail/siganalysis>`__, create a
        feature branch, and then submit a pull request. `GitHub
        Flow <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__ is
        summarized as:
        
        -  Anything in the ``master`` branch is deployable
        -  To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of
           ``master`` (e.g., ``new-oauth2-scopes``)
        -  Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the
           same named branch on the server
        -  When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for
           merging, open a `pull
           request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`__.
        -  After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you
           can merge it into master.
        -  Once it is merged and pushed to ``master``, you can and *should*
           deploy immediately.
        
        Running the Tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `siganalysis <https://github.com/questrail/siganalysis>`__ has been
        tested against Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. While
        `siganalysis <https://github.com/questrail/siganalysis>`__ may work with
        other versions of Python, it hasn't been tested with anything else at
        this time. Assuming you have
        `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ and
        `virtualenvwrapper <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
        installed, you can run the following commands to clone the GitHub
        repository, create a virtualenv, and run the unit tests:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/questrail/siganalysis.git
            $ cd siganalysis
            $ mkvirtualenv siganalysis
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ nosetests
