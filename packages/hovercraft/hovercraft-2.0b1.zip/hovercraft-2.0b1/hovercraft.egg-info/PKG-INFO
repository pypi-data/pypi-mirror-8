        *The merge of convenience and cool!*
        
        Hovercraft! is a tool to make impress.js_ presentations from
        reStructuredText. For a quick explanation, see the demo_.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Write your presentations in a text markup language. No slow, limiting GUI, no annoying HTML!
        
        * Pan, rotate and zoom in 3D, with automatic repositioning of slides!
        
        * A presenter console with notes and slide previews!
        
        * The slide show generated is in HTML, so you only need a web browser to show it.
        
        * Easy sharing, as it can be put up on a website for anyone to see!
        
        Full documentation is available at readthedocs.org_, and also in the
        documentation subdirectory.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Hovercraft requires Python 3.2 or later, and can be installed like any Python package.
        The easiest way is to install pip_, and then run::
        
            $ pip install hovercraft
        
        Hovercraft is untested on Windows, but there is no reason it shouldn't work, at least in theory.

        Changes
        =======
        
        2.0b1 (2014-11-27)
        ------------------
        
        - IMPORTANT! The positioning has been reimplemented. The most important change
          is that there is no longer any calculation of relative movement when you use
          absolute coordinates. Therefore, if you use absolute coordinates on some slides
          and then have no coordinates on other slides, your positioning may no longer
          be correct with version 2.0.
        
        - Relative coordinates (starting with r) are now supported for all positioning,
          attributes including rotation and scaling.
        
        - Images can now also have a :class: attribute.
        
        - Having the "Requires Python 3" error when setup.py runs messes with some
          tools, so I moved it to a custom install class instead.
        
        - Now includes a server-mode, that will serve the presentation via http and
          also re-generate the presentation if the source-files change.
        
        - Added support for multiple levels of slides. This is to make it able
          to support for example Reveal.js through external templates.
        
        - Moved the "note" XML transformation into the templates, as this is an
          impress.js feature, and other libraries, such as Reveal.js, will render
          it differently.
        
        
        1.1 (2013-03-15)
        ----------------
        
        - ReST comments are no longer rendered to HTML. [carljm]
        
        - Fixed a bug in the path handling for CSS resources. [carljm]
        
        - Various fixes and improvements in ReST handling. [cjw296]
        
        
        1.0 (2013-02-22)
        ----------------
        
        - #1, #2: Add key-binding to pop up the help, a parameter and a presentation
          field setting to not show the help at load.
        
        - Added documentation for #8: Naming steps.
        
        - #7: You can now define CSS-files to be included with a :css:-field in the
          presentation.
        
        - #3: You can now leave out the presenter notes from the output with the
          parameter -n or --skip-notes
        
        - Added a "simple" template that has no presenter console.
        
        - Updated to impress-console 1.1, fixing a Firefox bug.
        
        - Added support for more HTML metadata.
        
        - Finished documentation and examples.
        
        
        1.0b2 (2013-02-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Added syntax highlighting support.
        
        - #9: All positioning variables except data-x and data-y are now "sticky" so
              they will keep their previous value if not defined.
        
        - Documentation on https://hovercraft.readthedocs.org/
        
        
        1.0b1 (2013-02-07)
        ------------------
