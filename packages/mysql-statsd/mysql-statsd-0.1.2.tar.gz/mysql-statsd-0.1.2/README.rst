Daemon that gathers statistics from MySQL and sends them to statsd.

-  Free software: BSD license
-  Documentation: http://mysql-statsd.rtfd.org.

Usage / Installation
====================

Install mysql\_statsd through pip(pip is a python package manager,
please don't use sudo!):

::

    pip install mysql_statsd

If all went well, you'll now have a new executable called mysql\_statsd
in your path.

Running mysql\_statsd
---------------------

::

    $ mysql_statsd --config /etc/mysql-statsd.conf 

Assuming you placed a config file in /etc/ named mysql-statsd.conf

See our example
`configuration <https://github.com/spilgames/mysql-statsd/blob/master/docs/mysql-statsd.conf>`__

Running the above command will start mysql\_statsd in deamon mode. If
you wish to see it's output, then run the command with -f / --foreground

Usage
-----

::

    $ mysql_statsd --help
    usage: mysql_statsd.py [-h] [-c FILE] [-d] [-f]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c FILE, --config FILE
                            Configuration file
      -d, --debug           Debug mode
      -f, --foreground      Dont fork main program

At the moment there is also a `deamon
script <https://github.com/spilgames/mysql-statsd/blob/master/docs/mysql_statsd>`_
for this package

You're more than welcome to help us improve it!

Platforms
---------

We would love to support many other kinds of database servers, but
currently we're supporting these:

-  MySQL 5.1
-  MySQL 5.5
-  Galera

Both MySQL versions supported with Percona flavour as well as vanilla.

Todo:
~~~~~

Support for the following platforms

-  Mysql 5.6
-  MariaDB

We're looking forward to your pull request for other platforms

Development installation
------------------------

To install package, setup a `python virtual
environment <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_

Install the requirements(once the virtual environment is active):

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

*NOTE: MySQL-Python package needs mysql\_config command to be in your
path.*

There are future plans to replace the mysql-python package with
`PyMySQL <https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL>`_

After that you're able to run the script through

::

    $ python mysql_statsd/mysql_statsd.py

Coding standards
----------------

We like to stick with the python standard way of working:
`PEP-8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
