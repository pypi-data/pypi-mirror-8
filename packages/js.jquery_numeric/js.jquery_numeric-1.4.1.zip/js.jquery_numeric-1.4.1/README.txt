js.jquery_numeric
*****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jquery numeric`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jquery numeric`: https://github.com/SamWM/jQuery-Plugins/blob/master/numeric

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_numeric``) are published to some URL.
