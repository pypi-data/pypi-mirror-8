Python bindings for the Ironic API
==================================

This is a client for the OpenStack `Ironic
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic>`_ API. It provides a Python API (the
``ironicclient`` module) and a command-line interface (``ironic``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the
`OpenStack wiki <http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute>`_. The master
repository is on `git.openstack.org
<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/python-ironicclient>`_.

``python-ironicclient`` is licensed under the Apache License like the rest
of OpenStack.
