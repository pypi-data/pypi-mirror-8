FORTPY: Revision History
======

Revision 1.1.5
------

- Fixed issue #20
- Fixed a "No summary for element." error in the intellisense that was returning no summary when one actually existed.

Revision 1.1.4
------

- Fixed an error in `fortpy.f90` where a failing condition on the first part of an if statement that used `.and.` wasn't exiting the condition without evaluating the second part. This seems to be a quirk of the gfortran compiler.
- Fixed issue #19
- Fixed issue #18
- Fixed issue #17

Revision 1.1.3
------

- Reversed the renaming of the variables kinds (e.g. `dp`) in `fortpy.f90` because they were breaking unit tests that previously functioned correctly. Opened an issue to address the problem.

Revision 1.1.2
------

- Fixed a bug where parameters with `regular="true"` weren't being found because the dictionary had lower-case keys and the variable name was upper-case.
- Fixed parser bug for displaying and saving modifiers on executables.
- Fixed parser bug for determining the dependency modules.
- Added support for identifying modules that require pre-processing before compilation.
- Added configuration section `<libraries>` to fortpy `config.xml`. Allows libraries to be explicitly specified for inclusion when linking the unit testing executable.
- Added rule to the auto-generated makefile for creating a shared library of the executable being unit tested and all of its dependencies.

Revision 1.1.1
------

- Fixed parsing issues when identifying dependency calls inside of executables. This also fixed some isense issues caused by broken dependencies definitions.

Revision 1.1.0
------

- Added multiple cache support so that unit testing doesn't affect the "production" cache.
- Fixed versioning issue where the cache was not being invalidated when incompatible changes are made to the structure of classes that get serialized.
- Minor version release because of additional unit testing support and new support for interfaces.

Revision 1.0.13
------

- Added feature for auto-generating the global variable for custom types whose embedded methods are being tested. Usually, a `regular="true"` attribute is required to auto-generate a global variable. However, when embedded types are being called, they seldomly get commented with `<parameter>` tags because it is well understood that the first argument is the type/class instance.
- Fixed issue #9
- Added limited support for interfaces. Generic interfaces are supported with isense now. Although the parsers will handle the operator and assignment interfaces, support is not yet provided for actually using the symbols defined in those interfaces.
- Fixed issue #11
- Added more intelligent completions for embedded methods in derived types. Previously, all members and module procedures in an embedded type were returned with %-completion; now if the symbol is preceded by `call`, only embedded subroutine definitions are returned.

Revision 1.0.12
------

- Debugged error where the first parameter to an embedded procedure on a derived type was still being explicitly passed in to the embedded procedure. Since the compiler does that automatically, it was choking.

Revision 1.0.11
------

- Debugged the first real unit test case of an embedded method unit test.
- Debugged some additional allocation problems with auto-generated parameters in the unit testing.

Revision 1.0.10
------

- Fixed a bug that was preventing deferred shape arrays from being allocated automatically by fortpy in unit testing.

Revision 1.0.9
------

- Fixed a bug when comparing two simple representations where the second file has more entries than the first one.
- Fixed a misrepresentation of match success in the testing. The framework was using `common_match` in the `percent_match` routine which made wrong results seem a lot better.
- Added coloring to the terminal output for all packages.

Revision 1.0.8
------

- Fixed bug in `fortpy.pysave` that made 2d saving not produce tabular input.
- Fixed bug that crashed the program when `<isense>` was not present in the `config.xml` file.
- Added support for automated profiling of methods being tested using the -profile argument to `scripts/runtests.py`.

Revision 1.0.7
------

- Added `timed="true"` attribute support to the `<test>` tag.
- Fixed bug where an empty folder being cleaned would raise an exception on `remove()`
- Added a check for executables being tested to make sure they have a `public` modifier or are in the list of public symbols in the parent module.
- Added debug compile option to unit testing.
- Fixed automatic allocation errors for pointers.
- Fixed fortpy.f90 line and value counting routines.
- Added support for arrays of derived types; still get suggestions for embedded members if operating on an element of an array of derived types.
- Fixed a bug in `parsers.types` where "endtype" was not recognized.
- Added `<isense>` section to `config.xml` with an option to uppercase the builtin Fortran names
  by default with the suggestions.

Revision 1.0.6
------

- Fixed issue with fortpy/templates directory not being installed.

Revision 1.0.5
------

- Fixed issue with the builtin.xml file not being included in the distribution.

Revision 1.0.4
------

- Added support for gfortran compilation in unit testing
- Altered testing XML template to use `<test>` instead of `<outcome>`
  - Allow multiple inputs using `<input>` tags instead of comma-separated list.
  - Allow multiple output comparisons with `<output>` tags instead of comma-separated list.
  - Added _description_ attribute to `<test>` tag.
- Constant-input mode for testing. When a `<line>` template is specified for an `<input>` tag, the call to the main method being unit tested can be repeated for each line in that input file.
- Altered testing XML template to use `<assignment>` instead of `<instance>`.
- Variable value assignments directly from files.
  - `<assignment>` tag now accepts additional attributes _folder_, _file_ and _rename_.
- Major overhaul of underlying classes for the unit testing to make future feature enhancements much easier. Added the `elements` module in the `isense` package.
- Added support for built-in functions using information documented from a textbook that is now in `builtin.xml`. Added the `builtin` module to parse and cache that XML documentation.
