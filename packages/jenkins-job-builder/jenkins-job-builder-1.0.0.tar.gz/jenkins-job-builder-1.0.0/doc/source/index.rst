Jenkins Job Builder
===================

Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins_ jobs in
YAML_ format, and uses them to configure Jenkins.  You can keep your
job descriptions in human readable text format in a version control
system to make changes and auditing easier.  It also has a flexible
template system, so creating many similarly configured jobs is easy.
