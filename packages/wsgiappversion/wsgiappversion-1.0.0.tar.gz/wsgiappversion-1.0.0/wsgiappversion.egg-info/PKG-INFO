Description: wsgiappversion
        ==============
        
        What does it do?
        ----------------
        
        Adds a ``/version`` url that returns a json response of the current
        application version.
        
        Example usage:
        
          .. code-block:: python
        
              from wsgiappversion import ApplicationVersion
              from my_project import MyWSGIApp
        
              application = MyWSGIApp()
              application = ApplicationVersion(application, determine_version='my_project')
        
        The required ``determine_version`` argument is used to determine what the
        current version actually is. ``determine_version`` can be either a string or a
        callable that takes no arguments. When a string is used then the version is
        determined by calling ``pkg_resources.require(package_name)``. If that would
        not work for your application then a callable that returns the correct
        version can be used.
        
        Since a package version would likely not change without an application
        restart we would recommend using a closure (or some other similar method of
        caching a value) as your callable.
