Description: 
        
        Municiaplities for which we contribute to `OneGov`_ often require a public list
        of contacts. For the customers and us this package needs to scratch the
        following itches:
        
        - The directory must not force a set of fields on the user. Each customer
          should have the option to create its own set of fields. At the same time
          there should be at least one reasonable standard.
        
        - Some fields should only be visible with certain permissions.
        
        - It must be possible to put people into various organisations and show the
          membership of those organisations.
        
        Design
        ------
        
        This is how it is done:
        
        - We give the user the possiblity to define a list of people. Each list
          consists of a number of dexterity objects with IPerson behavior. Within
          one list only one dexterity type is allowed.
        
        - This list of people is the same for all lists of people - it's just that 
          the contained people must all have the same type.
        
        - Through the schema of the dexterity type we define the fields, their
          required read and write permissions, the fields shown in the list, the order
          of those fields, the fields available for filtering in the list, and the 
          fields shown in the detail view.
        
        - These dexterity types may be installed by any package or they may be included
          in seantis.people, available through separate profiles. (It's technically
          even possible to create them through the web, but we don't recommend this
          approach for various reasons.)
        
        - Any folderish type can be an organization. For people to be members of an
          organization, a membership type can be added to such a folderish type. This
          membership type links to the actual person object.
        
        - We identify the organization solely by url and title. This makes
          organisations very flexible. For example, with `seantis.cover.people`_
          we implemented organisations using collective.cover.
        
        Installation & Usage
        --------------------
        
        To see what it's all about install seantis.people using buildout (we assume
        you know how to do that) and activate the add-on using the controlpanel.
        
        Note that we don't provide any styling for seantis.people. We build on
        `plonetheme.onegov`_ and try to keep our HTML as simple as possible.
        
        Having installed seantis.people be sure to open the seantis.people controlpanel
        found on the plone contrlpanel (under "Add-on Configuration").
        
        There you can select the Person type you would like to use. Currently this
        will without a doubt be "Seantis People - Standard". To use it, click
        "Install":
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seantis/seantis.people/master/screenshots/readme-01-controlpanel.png
           :alt: Controlpanel Screenshot
        
        Having done that, go to the front-page or to wherever you want to place a list
        of people and add them:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seantis/seantis.people/master/screenshots/readme-02-add-list.png
           :alt: Add List of People Screenshot
        
        On the people's list you can now add people. You can only add people of the
        same type together on the same list:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seantis/seantis.people/master/screenshots/readme-03-add-contact.png
           :alt: Add Contact Screenshot
        
        Going back to the list you will notice that this person does not belong to
        an organisation. To add a person to an organisation you can simply create
        a folder with the name of the organisation as its title:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seantis/seantis.people/master/screenshots/readme-04-add-folder.png
           :alt: Add Folder Screenshot
        
        Finally, add the person to the organisation by creating a membership and
        referncing the person:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seantis/seantis.people/master/screenshots/readme-05-add-membership.png
           :alt: Add Folder Screenshot
        
        Your list of people should now look something like this:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seantis/seantis.people/master/screenshots/readme-06-result.png
           :alt: Add Folder Screenshot
        
        Status
        ------
        
        Seantis.people is used in production already. Though it's one of our newer
        modules so it hasn't been as battle tested as some of our other offerings.
        
        Once we feel perfectly confident about this you'll see an 1.0 release.

          person from the person list for anonymous users.
          [href]
        
        - Removes start/end on memberships. This module will no longer deal with

          [href]
        
        - Images on the people's list are rendered smaller and in the detail view they

        - Adds the ability to define custom titles on the person. Currently the custom
          title is only relevant for the detail view. To use add a custom_titles
          dictionary to the person object with the key being the field anme and the
          value being the title that should be used in the detail view.
          [href]

          than by portal_type to support inheritance.
        
        - Changes membership id/title to include the role as well as the name of
          the referenced person. Closes #13.
          [href]
        
        - Fixes a crash when viewing a public directory with private organisations.
          Closes #12.
