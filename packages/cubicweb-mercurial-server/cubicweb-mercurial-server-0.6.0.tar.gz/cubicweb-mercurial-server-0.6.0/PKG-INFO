Description: Summary
        -------
        mercurial server integration cube
        
        
        Simple setup
        ------------
        
        This is the simplest setup, with mercurial-server and the Cubicweb
        application running on the same server.
        
        * get and install mercurial-server::
        
              apt-get install mercurial-server
        
          Or from sources::
        
              hg clone http://hg.opensource.lshift.net/mercurial-server
              # remove installdoc from installfiles target of Makefile, then run (as root):
              # (files go to /etc/mercurial-server and /var/lib/mercurial-server)
              # (command line for debian-like systems, for redhat like, see official doc).
              make setup-adduser
        
          Official documentation can be found at http://www.lshift.net/mercurial-server.html
          and in the README file in the mercurial-server sources.
        
        * login as the user running the Cubicweb app with the mercurial_server cube;
          make sure this user has a rsa ssh key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and run::
        
              sudo mkdir -p /etc/mercurial-server/keys/root/$USER
              sudo cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /etc/mercurial-server/keys/root/$USER
              sudo -u hg /usr/local/share/mercurial-server/refresh-auth
        
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        The user running the Cubicweb instance must have the SSH key registered in
        mercurial-server configuration (see above) unlocked and available through an
        SSH agent.
        
        Run and connect to the web interface, and add a new mercurial-server repository.
        
        You can clone it immediately, start coding and push it back to the server.
        
        Your changes are integrated into the CW application on a regular basis through a
        vcsfile cube recurring task (see [VCSFILE] check-revision-interval setting in
        your all-in-one.conf).
        
        
        Permission levels
        -----------------
        
        The 'deny', 'read' and 'write' permission levels are supported by all versions
        of mercurial-server.  The 'publish' permission level is added by
        https://bitbucket.org/lshift/mercurial-server/pull-request/2/add-support-for-phases.
