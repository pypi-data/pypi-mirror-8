========================================================================

ulvl is a simple library which reads and writes universal level formats.


INSTALLATION

Run setup.py with the "install" command, e.g.:

    python setup.py install


USAGE

Inport the ulvl library in your project file.  You can then save and
load levels with the ulvl.ASCL and ulvl.JSL classes.  Each one saves and
loads a different format.

See the docstrings for detailed information.  Access them with the help
function, e.g. `help(ulvl)`.
