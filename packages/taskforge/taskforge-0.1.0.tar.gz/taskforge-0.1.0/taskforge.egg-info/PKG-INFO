        plugins:
          - nickname: Emailotron
            # the entrypoint for your plugin needs to inherit from
            # `taskforge.plugins.Base`
            entrypoint: emailotron:Emailer
            # plugins are run in ascending weight order. Plugins with the same
            # weight may be run in any order
            weight: 0
            enabled: false
            # plugins are initialized with the contents of this options field
            options:
              some: thing
        ```
        
        # Plugins
        
        Yes, that's right, you can build your own plugins! Just add your plugin to the
        list in the plugins section and set `enabled: true`.
