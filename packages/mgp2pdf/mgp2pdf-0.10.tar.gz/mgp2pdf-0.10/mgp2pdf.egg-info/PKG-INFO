Description: mgp2pdf
        =======
        
        This is a quick-and-dirty MagicPoint_ to PDF converter.
        
        .. _MagicPoint: http://member.wide.ad.jp/wg/mgp/
        
        It supports only a subset of MagicPoint, specifically, the subset I've
        used in my slides so far.  If you send me your slide decks, I'll make
        mgp2pdf handle them too.
        
        SUPPORT.rst has a list of supported and unsupported features.
        
        BUGS.rst has a list of known bugs.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install mgp2pdf
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            mgp2pdf [-v] [--unsafe] slides.mgp [-o output.pdf]
            mgp2pdf [-v] [--unsafe] slides.mgp ... [-o directory]
            mgp2pdf [-h|--help]
        
        
        Why another converter?
        ----------------------
        
        I used mgp to produce slides for a Python course I taught at Vilnius
        University.  However, since most of the students are not (yet) Linux
        users, they couldn't use MagicPoint to view my slides at home.  There are
        some converters from MagicPoint to PostScript/HTML, but the result either
        looks ugly, or doesn't support Unicode characters.  MagicPoint itself can
        produce a number of bitmaps (by taking screenshots), but those are big,
        and the conversion process is inconvenient (you cannot use your machine
        while mgp is busy rendering slides and taking screenshots).
        
        I wrote a Python program to interpret MagicPoint commands and produce a
        PDF file using ReportLab.  It can handle my slides (Lithuanian), but
        otherwise it is probably incomplete.  Feel free to give it a try.  File
        bugs for missing features, and I'll see what I can do.

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.10 (2015-01-06)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - ``%filter`` is disabled by default for being a security risk.  Use
          ``--unsafe`` to enable.
        
        - ``-o DIRECTORY`` is now supported.
        
        - Interpret image paths relative to the location of the mgp file.
        
        - Support Python 3.3 and up in addition to 2.6 and 2.7.
        
        - More accurate text positioning (mgp2pdf no longer truncates the
          corrdinates to integral point values).
        
        - More color names are now recognized: white, red, green, blue, yellow.
        
        - Better font name recognition (requires ``fc-match`` from fontconfig).
        
        - Improved error handling and reporting.
        
        - Support ``%%`` comment syntax.
        
        - Corrected handling of ``%default``, ``%tab``, ``%deffont``.
        
        - Implemented ``%include``.
        
        - Implemented ``%newimage -raise`` (also discovered that mgp itself ignores
          ``-raise``).
        
        - 100% test coverage.
        
        
        0.9 (2014-05-09)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
