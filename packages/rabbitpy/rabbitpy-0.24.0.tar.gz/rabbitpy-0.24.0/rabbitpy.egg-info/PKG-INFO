        Installation
        ------------
        
        rabbitpy may be installed via the Python package index with the tool of
        your choice. I prefer pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install rabbitpy
        
        But there's always easy_install:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            easy_install rabbitpy
