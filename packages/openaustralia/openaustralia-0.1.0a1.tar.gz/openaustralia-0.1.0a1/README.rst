This is a python wrapper for the `OpenAustralia API <http://www.openaustralia.org.au/api>`_.

NOTE: This isn't officially affiliated with the `OpenAustralia <http://www.openaustralia.org.au>`_ project. 
It's just something I'm playing around with. Suggestions / contributions towards making this more useful are welcome.
