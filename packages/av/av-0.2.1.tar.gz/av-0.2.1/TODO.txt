The Big Picture
===============

- Lots of documentation
- Uniform time representation
- High-level APIs


NEXT
====

- Make able to build on various fedoras at Western Post
  - PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/ffmpeg/fedora-14/ffmpeg-0.11/lib/pkgconfig

- Be able to read from devices: open(':0', 'r', 'x11grab')

- Stream.encode should return a list of packets. Otherwise, resampling
  can easily result in a massive buffer in a fifo or codec


Encoding
========

- Make everything mutable. Later, we can introduce a PseudoMutable base class
  for everything that has a .assert_mutable() method and public is_read_only


Time
====

- What are the various rates and scales?

  see: http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/libav-user/2011-December/001041.html
  see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12234949/ffmpeg-time-unit-explanation-and-av-seek-frame-method/16739755#16739755

  - Stream.guessed_rate or AVStream.r_frame_rate:
    FFmpeg's guess as to the frame rate. Often 24/1.

  - Stream.average_rate or AVStream.avg_frame_rate:
    Average frame rate that has been inspected in the file. This is what VLC
    reports in the media information. Often near 24/1.

    It may calculate this from 20 frames; see: http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/libavformat_2utils_8c_source.html#l02768

  - Stream.time_base or AVStream.time_base:
    Duration of one time unit for AVStream times.

  - Stream.rate or CodecContext.time_base:
      The length of a single frame as reported by the file. Sometimes 1/24,
      sometimes really really wrong.

  possibilities for discrepencies:
    - .mov supports a fixed frame rate
    - .mp4 does not support a fixed frame rate?
    - see: http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/libavformat_2utils_8c_source.html#l02647


High-Level API (Conveniences)
=============================

- Container.demux(video=True)
- Container.demux(video=2, audio=2) first 2 video and audio streams OR
  Container.demux(video=0, audio=0) first video and audio
- Container.decode(*args_for_demux, **kwargs_for_demux) -> straight to frames
- Stream.mux(frame) -> encode, flush, and mux
- Container.__del__ -> flush the streams and close
- Container.add_stream(template=stream)


Unsorted
========

- atexit.register something to clean up FFmpeg threads


- Investigate adding Python-defined formats. Then we could pull frames from
  webcams via OS X APIs.

- Directly use the Numpy C-API
  - see: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/c-api.array.html
  - see: https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/tutorials-numpy#c-api-initalization

- Move the logic regard initializating a VideoReformatter into the object
  itself instead of the VideoFrame.reformat method.

- Protocol for streams to pull packets from iterators. Then secondary streams
  get easier: container.add_stream('audio_codec', source=av.open('music.aiff').iter_packets(only_primary=True))

- Create Codec Descriptor

- Make av.utils.SmartPointer to wrap around a pointer?

runtime_library_dirs

- Look at how stream alloc works; can we manually do this and register the
  stream on a format context later?

- Context use a StringIO or similar to write into/from?
    - Create wrapper around AVIOContext for arbitrary Python object with read/write
      methods.

- libavdevice? Pull from video input?

- Various AudioLayout/AudioFormat/VideoFormat attributes should be writable.
    - is_mutable flags on various objects (including formats, layouts, contexts,
      streams, etc.) could guard the __set__ methods of properties.

- Should methods be: to_bytes, as_bytes, tobytes, asbytes??

- Plane.array_format could be a format string for array.array
- Plane.update_from_array(array.array)
    - If it were HD RGB then it would be 1920 * 1080 * 3 long.
- Plane.update_from_ndarray(numpy.ndarray)
    - If it were HD RGB then it would have shape (1080, 1920, 3)
- Plane.update(input_)
    And then it tries if it is a buffer, memoryview, bytes, etc..

- Stream.encode(...) -> list of packets, automatically checking buffer)
- Context.mux(...) -> take a single packet, or an iterator of them:
        context.mux(stream.encode(frame))

- Context.add_stream(codec_name, frame_rate) -> Context.streams.append(Stream(codec_name, frame_rate))?

- TestCase.rms_diff(one, two) -> Root-mean-square diff
- try to wrap API of testsrc filters
