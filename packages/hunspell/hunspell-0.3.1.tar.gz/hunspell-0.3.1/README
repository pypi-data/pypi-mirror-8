ABOUT PYHUNSPELL
================
Pyhunspell is a set of Python bindings for the Hunspell spellchecker engine. It
lets developers load Hunspell dictionaries, check words, get suggestions, add
new words, etc. It also provides some basic morphological analysis related
methods. Basic usage instructions are at UsingPyHunspell.

LICENSE
=======
It's not entirely clear under which license PyHunspell is released. On the
homepage it says LGPL, but in the source it says GPL. Since I believe the source
has precedence, I will release this under GPL until the original tells me to do
otherwise. For the full license, see COPYING.
