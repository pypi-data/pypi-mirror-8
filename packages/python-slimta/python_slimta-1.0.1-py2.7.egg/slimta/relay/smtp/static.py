    Connections may be recycled when possible, to send multiple messages over a

    :param host: Host string to connect to.
    :param port: Port to connect to.
    :param pool_size: At most this many simultaneous connections will be open
                      to the destination. If this limit is reached and no
                      connections are idle, new attempts will block.
    :param tls: Optional dictionary of TLS settings passed directly as
                keyword arguments to :class:`gevent.ssl.SSLSocket`.
    :param tls_required: If given and True, it should be considered a delivery
                         failure if TLS cannot be negotiated by the client.
    :param connect_timeout: Timeout in seconds to wait for a client connection
                            to be successful before issuing a transient
                            failure.
    :param command_timeout: Timeout in seconds to wait for a reply to each SMTP
                            command before issuing a transient failure.
    :param data_timeout: Timeout in seconds to wait for a reply to message data
                         before issuing a transient failure.
    :param idle_timeout: Timeout in seconds after a message is delivered before
                         a QUIT command is sent and the connection terminated.
                         If another message should be delivered before this
                         timeout expires, the connection will be re-used. By
                         default, QUIT is sent immediately and connections are
                         never re-used.
    :param credentials: Information used to authenticate the created SMTP
                        sessions. This can be an iterable or a callable that
                        returns or generates an iterable. The iterable will be
                        passed as the arguments into the
                        :meth:`~slimta.smtp.client.Client.auth` method of the
                        session. By default, no authentication is attempted.

                           an argument to
                           :meth:`~slimta.envelope.Envelope.encode_7bit` when
