        What is it?
        ===========
        
        collective.superfish integrates the `jQuery Superfish plugin`_ into Plone.
        
        Superfish is a really nice solution for dropdown menus using css, valid xhtml
        and JavaScript which degrades gracefully if JavaScript is not available.
        
        .. _`jQuery Superfish plugin`: http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/
        
        
        .. ATTENTION::
        
            Dropdown currently does not work on iOS devices.
            The `hoverintent.js` requires jQuery 1.9.1+ and Plone 4.3.3 ships with 1.7.2
        
            see https://github.com/collective/collective.superfish/issues/1 for
            workarounds or use 0.X releases
        
        How do i use it?
        ================
        
        Hide `plone.global_sections` and replace it with `collective.superfish`
        in viewlets.xml somehow like this::
        
            <!-- superfish: use superfish instead of global_sections -->
            <hidden manager="plone.portalheader" skinname="MySkin">
                <viewlet name="plone.global_sections" />
            </hidden>
        
            <order manager="plone.portalheader" skinname="MySkin">
                <viewlet name="collective.superfish" insert-after="plone.global_sections" />
            </order>
        
        
        Customization
        =============
        
        
        Add portal_actions
        ------------------
        
        By default, `collecive.superfish` does not include portal_actions in the menu.
        To activate them, subclass the viewlet::
        
            from collective.superfish.browser.sections import SuperFishViewlet as SuperFishBase
        
            class SuperFishViewlet(SuperFishBase):
        
                ADD_PORTAL_TABS = True
        
        and register it for your skin::
        
            <browser:viewlet
                name="collective.superfish"
                manager="plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IPortalHeader"
                class=".viewlets.SuperFishViewlet"
                permission="zope2.View"
                layer=".interfaces.IThemeSpecific"/>
        
        
        Do not show arrows
        ------------------
        
        To not show the arrows for menuitems with subitems,
        customize the Javascript initialization::
        
        
            jQuery('ul.sf-menu').superfish({
                cssArrows: false
            });
        
        See http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/options/ for a complete
        list of available options.
        
        
        CSS Styles
        ----------
        
        By using superfish.css you should have everyting in place to get a working
        superfish navigation.
        
        Specific fixes and colors for plone's `Sunburst Theme` can be found in
        superfish-plone.css (you might deactivate these styles for your custom theme
        layer to not need to override these styles)
        
        You might want to have a look at the examples provided in the
        `superfish download <https://github.com/joeldbirch/superfish/archive/1.7.4.zip>`_
        
        eg: https://github.com/joeldbirch/superfish/tree/1.7.4/examples
        
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Add tests
        
        
        History
        =======
        
        1.0 - 2014-10-15
        ----------------
        
        - Update superfish.js from 1.4.8 to 1.7.3
          and hoverIntent.js from r5 to r7
          [fRiSi]
        
          .. ATTENTION:: This update breaks css compatibility with the previous version!
        
        - Add default formatting for superfish menu based on the `DEMO SKIN`
          in the `superfish default css
          <https://github.com/joeldbirch/superfish/blob/master/dist/css/superfish.css>`_
          to make it fit the `Sunburst Theme`
        
          Superfish Menu Layout changed from
        
          ``<li><span class="selected"><a .../></span></li>`` to
        
          ``<li class="selected"><a .../></li>``
        
          since javascript could not handle the
          additional span tag for setting the `.sf-with-ul` class.
          [fRiSi]
        
        
        0.6 - 2010-08-11
        ----------------
        
        - fixed dropdown for IE7 and IE8
          [fRiSi]
        
        - replace `'` with ``&#39;`` instead of ``&apos;`` since
          IE7/8 can't handle this xhtml entity
          (http://inthemaze.net/post/2008/04/08/46-ie7-and-apos)
          [fRiSi]
        
        
        0.5 - 2010-06-17
        ----------------
        
        -  use `official hoverIntent.js`_ with docstring and versioninfo
           and replaced ``(function($){})(jQuery);`` with
           ``jQuery(function($){});`` syntax so the script does not conflict with
           collective.carousel (when both are merged to the same file by portal_javascript).
           [fRiSi]
        
           .. _`official hoverIntent.js`: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.js
        
        0.4 - 2010-05-12
        ----------------
        
        - removed desc.replace(...) and added a custom entities method to fix #1.
          [saily]
        
        - don't use version in metadata.xml for the package version in setup.py.
          the metadata version this is meant to reflect the version of the GS profile
          and must not be mixed up with the package version.  [fRiSi]
        
        0.3 - 2010-03-17
        ----------------
        
        - Replace " with &quot; to keep valid HTML if description contains quotes.
          [saily]
        
        - Made id-generation more resistent against duplicated id's. We now use
          normalized urls to generate the item id.  [saily]
        
        - added support to include portal_tabs in the superfish navigation by setting
          ``ADD_PORTAL_TABS = True`` in subclasses [fRiSi]
        
        - added some documentation targeted at integrators [fRiSi]
        
        - don't render superfish_init.js with ``inline=True`` since this leads to
          strange errors in
          Products.ResourceRegistries-2.0b2-py2.6.egg/Products/ResourceRegistries/browser/scripts.pt
          eg when adding a `StaticText Portlet`
        
          ``AttributeError: 'DirContainedFileResource5' object has no attribute 'POST'``
        
          according to the `resourceregistry documentation`_ it's better to set inline to `False`
          in any case.
        
          .. _`resourceregistry documentation`: http://plone.org/documentation/kb/working-with-resourceregistries/registry-entry-parameters
        
        - Removed caching after some discussions with fRiSi.
          We left the code but disabled it by default, enable it again uncommenting
          the ram.cache line::
        
            #@ram.cache(_render_sections_cachekey)
            def render(self):
                return self.index()
        
        - Displaying superfish menu only when installed in portal_quickinstaller by
          adding a superfish-browserlayer through browserlayer.xml file.  [saily]
        
        - Changed default values for 'interval' and 'timeout' of hoverIntent which
          controls the show and hide process of the submenu. Read more about
          configuration of hoverIntent here: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
        
        0.2 - 2009-06-12
        ----------------
        
        - Moved from full to safe compression for javascript files.
          [saily]
        
        - Removed unused class attributes for SuperFishViewlet.
          [saily]
        
        - Added caching to improve rendering performance.
          [saily]
        
        0.1 - 2009-06-09
        ----------------
        
        - Initial import and idea  [saily]
