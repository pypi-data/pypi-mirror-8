benchline
=========

Python package with modules for small but important things I need and don't want to reinvent over and over again.

The name benchline comes from my son.  When he was little he loved to watch the show, "Thomas the Tank Engine" and the main character was a train who had his own "branch line" off the main line.  My son, at the time, couldn't pronouce branch line so he said "bench line".  

So, as I code it's fun to be reminded of him and remember that we don't have to be perfect to be awesome.
