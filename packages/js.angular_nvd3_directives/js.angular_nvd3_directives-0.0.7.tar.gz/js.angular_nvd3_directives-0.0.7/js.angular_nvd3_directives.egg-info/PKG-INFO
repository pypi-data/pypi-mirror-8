        **************************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `angularjs-nvd3-directives`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`angularjs-nvd3-directives`: https://github.com/cmaurer/angularjs-nvd3-directives
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.angular_nvd3_directives``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``angular_nvd3`` from ``js.angular_nvd3_directives`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.angular_nvd3_directives import angular_nvd3
          >>> angular_nvd3.need()
