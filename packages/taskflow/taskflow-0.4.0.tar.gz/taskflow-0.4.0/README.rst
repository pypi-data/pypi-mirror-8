TaskFlow
========

A library to do [jobs, tasks, flows] in a highly available, easy to understand
and declarative manner (and more!) to be used with OpenStack and other
projects.

- More information can be found by referring to the `developer documentation`_.

Testing and requirements
------------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because TaskFlow has many optional (pluggable) parts like persistence
backends and engines, we decided to split our requirements into two
parts: - things that are absolutely required by TaskFlow (you can't use
TaskFlow without them) are put into ``requirements-pyN.txt`` (``N`` being the
Python *major* version number used to install the package); - things that are
required by some optional part of TaskFlow (you can use TaskFlow without
them) are put into ``optional-requirements.txt``; if you want to use the
feature in question, you should add that requirements to your project or
environment; - as usual, things that required only for running tests are
put into ``test-requirements.txt``.

Tox.ini
~~~~~~~

Our ``tox.ini`` file describes several test environments that allow to test
TaskFlow with different python versions and sets of requirements installed.

To generate the ``tox.ini`` file, use the ``toxgen.py`` script by first
installing `toxgen`_ and then provide that script as input the ``tox-tmpl.ini``
file to generate the final ``tox.ini`` file.

*For example:*

::

    $ toxgen.py -i tox-tmpl.ini -o tox.ini

Developer documentation
-----------------------

We also have sphinx documentation in ``docs/source``.

*To build it, run:*

::

    $ python setup.py build_sphinx
