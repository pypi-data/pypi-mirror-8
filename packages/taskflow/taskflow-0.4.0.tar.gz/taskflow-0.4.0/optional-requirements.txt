# This file lists dependencies that are used by different pluggable (optional)
# parts of TaskFlow, like engines or persistence backends. They are not
# strictly required by TaskFlow (aka you can use TaskFlow without them), so
# they don't go into one of the requirements.txt files.

# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.
