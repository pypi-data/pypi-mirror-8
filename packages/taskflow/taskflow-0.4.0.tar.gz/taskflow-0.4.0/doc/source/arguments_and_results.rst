In TaskFlow, all flow and task state goes to (potentially persistent) storage.
That includes all the information that :doc:`atoms <atoms>` (e.g. tasks) in the
flow need when they are executed, and all the information task produces (via
serializable task results). A developer who implements tasks or flows can
specify what arguments a task accepts and what result it returns in several
ways. This document will help you understand what those ways are and how to use
those ways to accomplish your desired usage pattern.

.. glossary::

    Task arguments
        Set of names of task arguments available as the ``requires``
        property of the task instance. When a task is about to be executed
        values with these names are retrieved from storage and passed to
        |task.execute| method of the task.

    Task results
        Set of names of task results (what task provides) available as
        ``provides`` property of task instance. After a task finishes
        successfully, its result(s) (what the task |task.execute| method
        returns) are available by these names from storage (see examples
        below).


.. testsetup::

    from taskflow import task


Arguments specification
=======================

There are different ways to specify the task argument ``requires`` set.

Arguments inference
-------------------

Task arguments can be inferred from arguments of the |task.execute| method of
the task.

.. doctest::

    >>> class MyTask(task.Task):
    ...     def execute(self, spam, eggs):
    ...         return spam + eggs
    ...
    >>> sorted(MyTask().requires)
    ['eggs', 'spam']

Inference from the method signature is the ''simplest'' way to specify task
arguments. Optional arguments (with default values), and special arguments like
``self``, ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` are ignored on inference (as these names
have special meaning/usage in python).

.. doctest::

    >>> class MyTask(task.Task):
    ...     def execute(self, spam, eggs=()):
    ...         return spam + eggs
    ...
    >>> MyTask().requires
    set(['spam'])
    >>>
    >>> class UniTask(task.Task):
    ...     def execute(self, *args, **kwargs):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> UniTask().requires
    set([])

Rebinding
---------

**Why:** There are cases when the value you want to pass to a task is stored
with a name other then the corresponding task arguments name. That's when the
``rebind`` task constructor parameter comes in handy. Using it the flow author
can instruct the engine to fetch a value from storage by one name, but pass it
to a tasks |task.execute| method with another name. There are two possible ways
of accomplishing this.

The first is to pass a dictionary that maps the task argument name to the name
of a saved value.

For example, if you have task::

    class SpawnVMTask(task.Task):

        def execute(self, vm_name, vm_image_id, **kwargs):
            pass  # TODO(imelnikov): use parameters to spawn vm

and you saved 'vm_name' with 'name' key in storage, you can spawn a vm with
such 'name' like this::

    SpawnVMTask(rebind={'vm_name': 'name'})

The second way is to pass a tuple/list/dict of argument names. The length of
the tuple/list/dict should not be less then number of task required parameters.
For example, you can achieve the same effect as the previous example with::

    SpawnVMTask(rebind_args=('name', 'vm_image_id'))

which is equivalent to a more elaborate::

    SpawnVMTask(rebind=dict(vm_name='name',
                            vm_image_id='vm_image_id'))

In both cases, if your task accepts arbitrary arguments with ``**kwargs``
construct, you can specify extra arguments.

::

    SpawnVMTask(rebind=('name', 'vm_image_id', 'admin_key_name'))

When such task is about to be executed, ``name``, ``vm_image_id`` and
``admin_key_name`` values are fetched from storage and value from ``name`` is
passed to |task.execute| method as ``vm_name``, value from ``vm_image_id`` is
passed as ``vm_image_id``, and value from ``admin_key_name`` is passed as
``admin_key_name`` parameter in ``kwargs``.

Manually specifying requirements
--------------------------------

**Why:** It is often useful to manually specify the requirements of a task,
either by a task author or by the flow author (allowing the flow author to
override the task requirements).

To accomplish this when creating your task use the constructor to specify
manual requirements.  Those manual requirements (if they are not functional
arguments) will appear in the ``kwargs`` of the |task.execute| method.

.. doctest::

    >>> class Cat(task.Task):
    ...     def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    ...         if 'requires' not in kwargs:
    ...             kwargs['requires'] = ("food", "milk")
    ...         super(Cat, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    ...     def execute(self, food, **kwargs):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> cat = Cat()
    >>> sorted(cat.requires)
    ['food', 'milk']

.. make vim sphinx highlighter happy**

When constructing a task instance the flow author can also add more
requirements if desired.  Those manual requirements (if they are not functional
arguments) will appear in the ``**kwargs`` the |task.execute| method.

.. doctest::

    >>> class Dog(task.Task):
    ...     def execute(self, food, **kwargs):
    ...         pass
    >>> dog = Dog(requires=("water", "grass"))
    >>> sorted(dog.requires)
    ['food', 'grass', 'water']

.. make vim sphinx highlighter happy**

If the flow author desires she can turn the argument inference off and override
requirements manually. Use this at your own **risk** as you must be careful to
avoid invalid argument mappings.

.. doctest::

    >>> class Bird(task.Task):
    ...     def execute(self, food, **kwargs):
    ...         pass
    >>> bird = Bird(requires=("food", "water", "grass"), auto_extract=False)
    >>> sorted(bird.requires)
    ['food', 'grass', 'water']

Results specification
=====================

In python, function results are not named, so we can not infer what a task
returns. This is important since the complete task result (what the
|task.execute| method returns) is saved in (potentially persistent) storage,
and it is typically (but not always) desirable to make those results accessible
to other tasks. To accomplish this the task specifies names of those values via
its ``provides`` task constructor parameter or other method (see below).

Returning one value
-------------------

If task returns just one value, ``provides`` should be string -- the
name of the value.

.. doctest::

    >>> class TheAnswerReturningTask(task.Task):
    ...    def execute(self):
    ...        return 42
    ...
    >>> TheAnswerReturningTask(provides='the_answer').provides
    set(['the_answer'])

Returning a tuple
-----------------

For a task that returns several values, one option (as usual in python) is to
return those values via a ``tuple``.

::

    class BitsAndPiecesTask(task.Task):
        def execute(self):
            return 'BITs', 'PIECEs'

Then, you can give the value individual names, by passing a tuple or list as
``provides`` parameter:

::

    BitsAndPiecesTask(provides=('bits', 'pieces'))

After such task is executed, you (and the engine, which is useful for other
tasks) will be able to get those elements from storage by name:

::

    >>> storage.fetch('bits')
    'BITs'
    >>> storage.fetch('pieces')
    'PIECEs'

Provides argument can be shorter then the actual tuple returned by a task --
then extra values are ignored (but, as expected, **all** those values are saved
and passed to the |task.revert| method).

.. note::

    Provides arguments tuple can also be longer then the actual tuple returned
    by task -- when this happens the extra parameters are left undefined: a
    warning is printed to logs and if use of such parameter is attempted a
    ``NotFound`` exception is raised.

Returning a dictionary
----------------------

Another option is to return several values as a dictionary (aka a ``dict``).

::

    class BitsAndPiecesTask(task.Task):

        def execute(self):
            return {
                'bits': 'BITs',
                'pieces': 'PIECEs'
            }

TaskFlow expects that a dict will be returned if ``provides`` argument is a
``set``:

::

    BitsAndPiecesTask(provides=set(['bits', 'pieces']))

After such task executes, you (and the engine, which is useful for other tasks)
will be able to get elements from storage by name:

::

    >>> storage.fetch('bits')
    'BITs'
    >>> storage.fetch('pieces')
    'PIECEs'

.. note::

    If some items from the dict returned by the task are not present in the
    provides arguments -- then extra values are ignored (but, of course, saved
    and passed to the |task.revert| method). If the provides argument has some
    items not present in the actual dict returned by the task -- then extra
    parameters are left undefined: a warning is printed to logs and if use of
    such parameter is attempted a ``NotFound`` exception is raised.

Default provides
----------------

As mentioned above, the default task base class provides nothing, which means
task results are not accessible to other tasks in the flow.

The task author can override this and specify default value for provides using
``default_provides`` class variable:

::

    class BitsAndPiecesTask(task.Task):
        default_provides = ('bits', 'pieces')
        def execute(self):
            return 'BITs', 'PIECEs'

Of course, the flow author can override this to change names if needed:

::

    BitsAndPiecesTask(provides=('b', 'p'))

or to change structure -- e.g. this instance will make whole tuple accessible
to other tasks by name 'bnp':

::

    BitsAndPiecesTask(provides='bnp')

or the flow author may want to return default behavior and hide the results of
the task from other tasks in the flow (e.g. to avoid naming conflicts):

::

    BitsAndPiecesTask(provides=())

Revert arguments
================

To revert a task engine calls its |task.revert| method. This method
should accept same arguments as |task.execute| method of the task and one
more special keyword argument, named ``result``.

For ``result`` value, two cases are possible:

* if task is being reverted because it failed (an exception was raised from its
  |task.execute| method), ``result`` value is instance of
  :py:class:`taskflow.utils.misc.Failure` object that holds exception
  information;

* if task is being reverted because some other task failed, and this task
  finished successfully, ``result`` value is task result fetched from storage:
  basically, that's what |task.execute| method returned.

All other arguments are fetched from storage in the same way it is done for
|task.execute| method.

To determine if task failed you can check whether ``result`` is instance of
:py:class:`taskflow.utils.misc.Failure`::

    from taskflow.utils import misc

    class RevertingTask(task.Task):

        def execute(self, spam, eggs):
            return do_something(spam, eggs)

        def revert(self, result, spam, eggs):
            if isinstance(result, misc.Failure):
                print("This task failed, exception: %s"
                      % result.exception_str)
            else:
                print("do_something returned %r" % result)

If this task failed (``do_something`` raised exception) it will print ``"This
task failed, exception:"`` and exception message on revert. If this task
finished successfully, it will print ``"do_something returned"`` and
representation of result.

Retry arguments
===============

A Retry controller works with arguments in the same way as a Task. But it has
an additional parameter 'history' that is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains
a result of the previous Retry run and a table where a key is a failed task and
a value is a :py:class:`taskflow.utils.misc.Failure`.

Consider the following Retry::

  class MyRetry(retry.Retry):

      default_provides = 'value'

      def on_failure(self, history, *args, **kwargs):
          print history
          return RETRY

      def execute(self, history, *args, **kwargs):
          print history
          return 5

      def revert(self, history, *args, **kwargs):
          print history

Imagine the following Retry had returned a value '5' and then some task 'A'
failed with some exception.  In this case ``on_failure`` method will receive
the following history::

    [('5', {'A': misc.Failure()})]

Then the |retry.execute| method will be called again and it'll receive the same
history.

If the |retry.execute| method raises an exception, the |retry.revert| method of
Retry will be called and :py:class:`taskflow.utils.misc.Failure` object will be
present in the history instead of Retry result::

    [('5', {'A': misc.Failure()}), (misc.Failure(), {})]

After the Retry has been reverted, the Retry history will be cleaned.
