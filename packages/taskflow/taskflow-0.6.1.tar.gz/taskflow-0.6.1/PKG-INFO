Description: TaskFlow
        ========
        
        A library to do [jobs, tasks, flows] in a highly available, easy to understand
        and declarative manner (and more!) to be used with OpenStack and other
        projects.

        Testing and requirements
        ------------------------
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Because TaskFlow has many optional (pluggable) parts like persistence
        backends and engines, we decided to split our requirements into two
        parts: - things that are absolutely required by TaskFlow (you can't use
        TaskFlow without them) are put into ``requirements-pyN.txt`` (``N`` being the
        Python *major* version number used to install the package); - things that are
        required by some optional part of TaskFlow (you can use TaskFlow without
        them) are put into ``optional-requirements.txt``; if you want to use the
        feature in question, you should add that requirements to your project or
        environment; - as usual, things that required only for running tests are
        put into ``test-requirements.txt``.
        
        Tox.ini
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Our ``tox.ini`` file describes several test environments that allow to test
        TaskFlow with different python versions and sets of requirements installed.
        Please refer to the `tox`_ documentation to understand how to make these test
        environments work for you.
        
        Developer documentation
        -----------------------
        
        We also have sphinx documentation in ``docs/source``.
