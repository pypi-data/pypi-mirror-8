    The information that a Department object holds is like:

      * and all the other things those are inherited from the AuditEntity class

    Two Department object considered the same if they have the same name, the
    the members list nor the lead info is important, a "Modeling" department
    should of course be the same with another department which has the name
    "Modeling" again.

    so creating a department object needs the following parameters:

    :param members: it can be an empty list, so one department can be created
      without any member in it. But this parameter should be a list of User
      objects.

    :param lead: this is a User object, that holds the lead information, a lead
      could be in this department but it is not forced to be also a member of
      the department. So another departments member can be a lead for another
      department. Lead attribute can not be empty or None.
