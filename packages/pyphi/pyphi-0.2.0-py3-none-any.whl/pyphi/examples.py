Usage and Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`pyphi.network` object is the main object on which computations are
performed. It represents the network of interest.

The :class:`pyphi.subsystem` object is the secondary object; it represents a
subsystem of a network. |big_phi| is defined on subsystems.

The :mod:`pyphi.compute` module is the main entry-point for the library. It
contains methods for calculating concepts, constellations, complexes, etc. See
its documentation for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Basic Example**


Let's make a simple 3-node network and compute its |big_phi|.

To make a network, we need a TPM, current state, past state, and optionally a
connectivity matrix. The TPM can be in more than one form; see the
documentation for :class:`pyphi.network`. Here we'll use the 2-dimensional
state-by-node form.

    >>> import pyphi
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> tpm = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0],
    ...                 [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]])

The current and past states should be |n|-tuples, where |n| is the number of
nodes in the network, where the |ith| element is the state of the |ith| node in
the network.

    >>> current_state = (1, 0, 0)
    >>> past_state = (1, 1, 0)

The connectivity matrix is a square matrix such that the |i,jth| entry is 1 if
there is a connection from node |i| to node |j|, and 0 otherwise.

    >>> cm = np.array([[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]])

Now we construct the network itself with the arguments we just created:

    >>> network = pyphi.Network(tpm, current_state, past_state,
    ...                         connectivity_matrix=cm)

The next step is to define a subsystem for which we want to evaluate |big_phi|.
To make a subsystem, we need the indices of subset of nodes which should be
included in it and the network that the subsystem belongs to.

In this case, we want the |big_phi| of the entire network, so we simply include
every node in the network in our subsystem:

    >>> subsystem = pyphi.Subsystem(range(network.size), network)

Now we use :func:`pyphi.compute.big_phi` function to compute the |big_phi| of
our subsystem:

    >>> phi = pyphi.compute.big_phi(subsystem)
    >>> round(phi, pyphi.constants.PRECISION)
    2.312498

If we want to take a deeper look at the integrated-information-theoretic
properties of our network, we can access all the intermediate quantities and
structures that are calculated in the course of arriving at a final |big_phi|
value by using :func:`pyphi.compute.big_mip`. This returns a deeply nested
object, |BigMip|, that contains data about the subsystem's constellation of
concepts, cause and effect repertoires, etc.

    >>> mip = pyphi.compute.big_mip(subsystem)

For instance, we can see that this network has 4 concepts:

    >>> len(mip.unpartitioned_constellation)
    4

The documentation for :mod:`pyphi.models` contains description of these
structures.

.. note::

    The network and subsystem discussed here are returned by the
    :func:`pyphi.examples.basic_network` and
    :func:`pyphi.examples.basic_subsystem` functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Residue Example**


This example describes a system containing two **AND** nodes, |A| and |B|, with
a single overlapping input node.

First let's create the subsystem corresponding to the residue network, with all
nodes off in the current and past states.

   >>> subsystem = pyphi.examples.residue_subsystem()

Next, we can define the mechanisms of interest:

   >>> A = subsystem.indices2nodes((0,))
   >>> B = subsystem.indices2nodes((1,))
   >>> AB = subsystem.indices2nodes((0, 1))

And the possible past purviews that we're interested in:

   >>> CD = subsystem.indices2nodes((2, 3))
   >>> DE = subsystem.indices2nodes((3, 4))
   >>> CDE = subsystem.indices2nodes((2, 3, 4))

We can then evaluate the cause information for each of the mechanisms over the
past purview |CDE|.

   >>> subsystem.cause_info(A, CDE)
   0.33333191666400036

   >>> subsystem.cause_info(B, CDE)
   0.33333191666400036

   >>> subsystem.cause_info(AB, CDE)
   0.49999972500000006

The composite mechanism |AB| has greater cause information than either of the
individual mechanisms. This contradicts the idea that |AB| should exist
minimally in this system.

Instead, we can quantify existence as the irreducible cause information of a
mechanism. The **MIP** of a mechanism is the partition of mechanism and purview
which makes the least difference to the cause repertoire (see
:class:`pyphi.models.Mip`). The irreducible cause information is the distance
between the unpartitioned and partitioned repertoires.

To calculate the MIP structure of mechanism |AB|:

   >>> mip_AB = subsystem.mip_past(AB, CDE)

We can then determine what the specific partition is.

   >>> mip_AB.partition
   (Part(mechanism=(), purview=(n2,)), Part(mechanism=(n0, n1), purview=(n3, n4)))

The labels ``(n0, n1, n2, n3, n4)`` correspond to nodes :math:`A, B, C, D, E`
respectively. Thus the MIP is |(AB / DE) x ([] / C)|, where :math:`[]` denotes
the empty mechanism.

The partitioned repertoire of the MIP can also be retrieved:

   >>> mip_AB.partitioned_repertoire.flatten(order='F')
   array([ 0.2,  0.2,  0.1,  0.1,  0.2,  0.2,  0. ,  0. ])

And we can then calculate the irreducible cause information as the difference
between partitioned and unpartitioned repertoires.

   >>> mip_AB.phi
   0.09999990000000035

One counterintuitive result which merits discussion is that since irreducible
cause information is what defines existence, we must also evaluate the
irreducible cause information of the mechanisms |A| and |B|.

The mechanism |A| over the purview |CDE| is completely reducible to |(A / CD) x
([] / E)| because |E| has no effect on |A|, so it has zero |small_phi|.

   >>> subsystem.mip_past(A, CDE)
   Mip(phi=0.0, direction='past', mechanism=(n0,), purview=(n2, n3, n4), partition=None, unpartitioned_repertoire=None, partitioned_repertoire=None)

Instead, we should evaluate |A| over the purview |CD|.

   >>> mip_A = subsystem.mip_past(A, CD)

In this case, there is a well defined MIP

   >>> mip_A.partition
   (Part(mechanism=(), purview=(n2,)), Part(mechanism=(n0,), purview=(n3,)))

which is |([] / C) x (A / D)|. It has partitioned repertoire

   >>> mip_A.partitioned_repertoire.flatten(order='F')
   array([ 0.33333333,  0.33333333,  0.16666667,  0.16666667])

and irreducible cause information

   >>> mip_A.phi
   0.16666700000000023

A similar result holds for |B|. Thus the mechanisms |A| and |B| exist at levels
of |small_phi = 1/6|, while the higher-order mechanism |AB| exists only as the
residual of causes, at a level of |small_phi = 1/10|.


A note on conventions
---------------------

**TPMs**


There are several ways to write down a TPM. With both state-by-state and
state-by-node TPMs, one is confronted with a choice about which rows correspond
to which states. In state-by-state TPMs, this choice must also be made for the
columns.

Either the first node changes state every other row:

    +------+-----+-----+
    | A, B |  A  |  B  |
    +======+=====+=====+
    | 0, 0 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 1, 0 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 0, 1 | 0.5 | 0.6 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 1, 1 | 0.7 | 0.8 |
    +------+-----+-----+

Or the last node does:

    +------+-----+-----+
    | A, B |  A  |  B  |
    +======+=====+=====+
    | 0, 0 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 0, 1 | 0.5 | 0.6 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 1, 0 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 1, 1 | 0.7 | 0.8 |
    +------+-----+-----+

Note that the index |i| of a row in a TPM encodes a network state: convert the
index to binary, and each bit gives the state of a node. The question is, which
node?

**Throughout PyPhi, we always choose the first conventionâ€”the first node's
state varies the fastest.**

Since numbers are written with the least-significant digit on the right, the
right-most digit varies the fastest. This means that according to our
convention, **the right-most (least-significant) bit gives the state of the
first node**.

We call this convention the **LOLI convention**: Low Order bits correspond to
Low Index nodes. The other convention, where the highest-index node varies the
fastest, is similarly called **HOLI**.

.. note::

    The rationale for this choice of convention is that the **LOLI** mapping is
    stable under changes in the number of nodes, in the sense that the same bit
    always corresponds to the same node index. The **HOLI** mapping does not
    have this property.

.. note::

    This obviously applies to only situations where decimal indices are
    encoding states. Whenever a network state is represented as a list or
    tuple, we use the only sensible convention: the |ith| element gives the
    state of the |ith| node.

.. note::

    There are various conversion functions available for converting between
    TPMs, states, and indices using different conventions: see the
    :mod:`pyphi.convert` module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Connectivity Matrices**


Throughout PyPhi, if ``CM`` is a connectivity matrix, then |CM[i][j] = 1| means
that node |i| is connected to node |j|.
