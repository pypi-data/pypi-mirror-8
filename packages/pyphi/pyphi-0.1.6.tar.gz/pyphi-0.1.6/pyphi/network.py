class Network:

    """A network of nodes.

    Represents the network we're analyzing and holds auxilary data about it.

    Example:
        In a 3-node network, ``a_network.tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the transition
        probabilities for each node at |t_0| given that state at |t_{-1}| was
        |N_0 = 0, N_1 = 0, N_2 = 1|.

    Args:
        tpm (np.ndarray): See the corresponding attribute.
        current_state (tuple): See the corresponding attribute.
        past_state (tuple): See the corresponding attribute.

    Keyword Args:
        connectivity_matrix (array or sequence): A square binary adjacency
            matrix indicating the connections between nodes in the network.
            ``connectivity_matrix[i][j] == 1`` means that node |i| is connected
            to node |j|. If no connectivity matrix is given, every node is
            connected to every node **(including itself)**.

    Attributes:
        tpm (np.ndarray):
            The transition probability matrix that encodes the network's
            mechanism. It can be provided in either state-by-node or
            state-by-state form. In state-by-state form, row *and* column
            indices must follow the **HOLI** convention (see note below). If
            given in state-by-node form, it can be either 2-dimensional, so
            that ``tpm[i]`` gives the probabilities of each node being on if
            the past state is given by the binary representation of |i|, where
            ``i`` represents a state according to the **LOLI** convention, or
            in N-D form, so that ``tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the probabilities of
            each node being on if the past state is |N_0 = 0, N_1 = 0, N_2 = 1|. The shape of the 2-dimensional form of the TPM must be ``(S,
            N)``, and the shape of the N-D form of the TPM must be ``[2] * N +
            [N]``, where ``S`` is the number of states and ``N`` is the number
            of nodes in the network.
        current_state (tuple):
            The current state of the network. ``current_state[i]`` gives the
            current state of node |i|.
        past_state (tuple):
            The past state of the network. ``past_state[i]`` gives the past
            state of node |i|.
        connectivity_matrix (np.ndarray):
            A square binary adjacency matrix indicating the connections between
            nodes in the network.
        size (int):
            The number of nodes in the network.
        num_states (int):
            The number of possible states of the network.

    .. note::
        Throughout PyPhi, when decimal indices of state-by-node TPM **rows**
        are used to represent the state of a set of binary nodes, the indices
        follow the **LOLI** convention: low-order bits of the binary
        representation of the index correspond to low-index nodes. The
        rationale is that this low-order to low-index mapping is stable under
        changes in the number of nodes, in the sense that the same bit always
        corresponds to the same node index.

    .. note::
        Column indices still use the more intuitive **HOLI** convention, so that
        when the row is read as a state-tuple, the index of the node gives the
        state of that node.
