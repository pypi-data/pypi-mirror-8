Running with Django 1.6
-----------------------

If you are running Django 1.6, please also install south for migrations::

    pip install south

South 1.0 fails with python 3, described `in this issue`_. To properly support
python 3 and Django 1.6, you need to install a patched version. The following
command should work::

    pip install 'https://bitbucket.org/andrewgodwin/south/get/e2c9102ee033.zip#egg=South
