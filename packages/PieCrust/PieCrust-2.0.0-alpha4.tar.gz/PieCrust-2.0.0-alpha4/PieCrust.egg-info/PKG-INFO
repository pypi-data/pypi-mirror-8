        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        If you want to quickly give it a spin:
        
        ::
        
            bin/chef init mywebsite
            cd mywebsite
            ../bin/chef serve
        
        It should create a new empty site in a ``mywebsite`` folder, and then start
        your default browser to show it to you. Use ``chef prepare page`` and ``chef
        prepare post`` to create pages and posts, and edit those in your favorite text
        editor.
        
        When you're happy, run ``../bin/chef bake`` to generate the final static
        website, which you'll find in ``_counter``.
