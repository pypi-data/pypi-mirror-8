===================================

Command line cross-cloud orchestration tool for constructing virtual datacenters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nepho is a command-line tool that orchestrates the creation of complete
working application stacks on virtual infrastructure. Initially
targeting Amazon Web Services as well as Vagrant, Nepho abstracts
datacenter creation, instance configuration, and application deployment
into portable "cloudlets" that can be shared between developers and
teams.

With Nepho, DevOps engineers can construct complete
infrastructure-as-code bundles ("cloudlets") that anyone can easily spin
up with a single command. Nepho is in active development.

To learn more about the key concepts and vocabulary of Nepho, please
view the `structure of a cloudlet`_ page.

Status
------

This project is new but being actively developed by the Cloud
Engineering team within Harvard University Information Technology. We
have released a stable 1.0 release that is being used by teams within
Harvard. We welcome your feedback and contributions!

Currently there are two main code branches:

-  **master** - refactoring into a generic *core*, vendor-specific
   *providers*, and *cloudlets* for each individual application/service
   environment.
-  **legacy** - legacy code for constructing CloudFormation stacks using
   Jinja2 templated JSON files, slowly being merged into master.

Installation
------------

---------------------
Standard installation
---------------------

View our `getting started guide`_ for complete instructions for setting
up Nepho and its dependencies.

On Windows, you will need to `install Python`_ in addition to the other
requirements, more detailed instructions for Windows users are coming
soon.

---------------------------------
Installation for developing Nepho
---------------------------------

If you plan to develop on the Nepho codebase you will want to follow the
instructions for `developer setup`_ using virtualenv.

Configuration
-------------

By default Nepho will create a hidden configuration directory in your
home directory (``~/.nepho``) although you can specify a different
location in the configuration file. Running the ``nepho scope`` command
will create a configuration file for you (``~/.nepho/config``) if one
does not exist, but in general you will not need to modify any of the
default configuration options.

Nepho passed configuration information into providers (i.e. AWS,
Vagrant) through a parameter management system. Each provider, cloudlet,
and blueprint may specify required or optional parameters. You can view
and manipulate parameters using the ``nepho parameter`` subcommand.

Examples of some common parameters (which use the CamelCase format):

-  AWSRegion: us-east-1
-  VagrantBackend: virtualbox
-  UpdatePackages: False

Usage
-----

Consult the built-in documentation (``nepho --help``) for the latest
information about commands and arguments. Nepho supports the following
five subcommands:

-  ``nepho cloudlet`` - find, download, and manage cloudlets
-  ``nepho blueprint`` - list and view individual cloudlet deployment
   blueprints
-  ``nepho stack`` - create, manage, and destroy stacks built from
   blueprints
-  ``nepho parameter`` - list, view and modify parameter settings
-  ``nepho scope`` - set a cloudlet (and optionally blueprint) scope for
   future commands

Find out more about each subcommand by running
``nepho <subcommand> --help``
