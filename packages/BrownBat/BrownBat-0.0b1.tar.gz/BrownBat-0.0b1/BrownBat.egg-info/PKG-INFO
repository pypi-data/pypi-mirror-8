Description: What is BrownBat ?
        --------------------------------
        
        **BrownBat** is a pure Python library to create source code generators.
        Its main features are:
         * Laziness everywhere: you can set every possible name or attribute after the object has been created and used, and 
           it will be taken into account when printed
           
         * Nifty operator overloading, making it quite easy to manipulate source code objects
         
        It currently handles C langage, but adding new langages leveraging all the facilities given by the core should be easy.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        **BrownBat** requires Python 3 to work correctly.
        It can be installed from PyPI (Python package index)::
        
            > pip install brownbat
