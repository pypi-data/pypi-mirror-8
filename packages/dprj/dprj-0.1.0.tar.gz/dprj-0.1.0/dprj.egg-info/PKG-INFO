Description: What's that?
        ============
        
        `dprj` is an algorithm that extracts sounds from words. It's similar to
        metaphone, except it's targeted at the french language only. While double
        metaphone or similar can be ok to regroup content that sound more or less the
        same, it becomes unusable when you want to get the real pronunciation of a
        word, since it's mainly targeted at english. And we all know french can be
        really tricky sometimes.
        
        How to use it?
        ==============
        
        Install it from PyPI::
        
            pip install dprj
        
        Then just use the ``say`` function:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >> from dprj import say
            >> say(u'chaussette')
            u'xst'
            >> say(u'psychologue')
            u'psklg'
            >> say(u'agglomération')
            u'glmrsn'
            >> say(u'accès')
            u'ks'
        
        How reliable is it?
        ===================
        
        Well, try it and see for yourself! There are still some cases to handle:
        
        * some plurals
        * some silent final letters (eg. 'r')
        * french weirdnesses
        
        If you get incorrect results for any word please let me know by filing and
        issue.
