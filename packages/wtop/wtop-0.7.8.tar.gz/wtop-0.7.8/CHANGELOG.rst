version 0.6.1, 2008 Jul 31
==========================

Improved
--------

- `--sort LIMIT:FIELD:DIRECTION` option for sorting and limiting aggregate
  queries.
- Added long options such as `--output` for `-o` and `--filter` for `-f`.
- Added aggregate functions `var()` (population variance) and `dev()` (standard
  deviation)
- Experimental `--x-tmp-dir=/tmp` option when you are running aggregates over
  large (> 10 million lines) logs. If you've run out of memory trying to run a
  logrep query, try this option. If not, don't use it.
- More cleanups, getting rid of special cases, etc.
- Several speedups, bugfixes, etc.


version 0.6.0, 2008 Jul 14
==========================

Improved
--------

- Added support for aggregate functions `avg()`, `min()`, `max()`, `count(*)`
  and `sum()` in grep mode.
- Added `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour` and `minute` fields for output (`-o`)
  and filters (`-f`)
- Minor speedups and cleanups.

Deprecated or Known Issues
--------------------------

- The `-g` and `-v` options are deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0
  unless there is a general uproar. `-f` filters are more accurate and
  generally faster.


version 0.5.9, 2008 Jul 10
==========================

Improved
--------

- Several small bugs.
- Support for Python 2.4. In earlier versions logrep required Python 2.5 or
  higher.
- Added a `!~` operator to the `-f FILTER` option. You can now filter out
  fields that do not match. For example, to see 'foo.html' hits that were NOT
  referred by 'example.com'::

    -f 'url~foo.html,ref!~www.example.com'

- Added a 'botname' field: it will show the substring from the user-agent field
  it matched to determine that the request came from a robot. You can filter
  and output it just like any other.
- Added `-R` option as a shorthand for `-f 'bot=1'`. Shows only traffic that is
  probably from a robot and not a human.

Deprecated or Known Issues
--------------------------

- The `-h` option (human traffic only) has been renamed `-H`. `-h` now outputs
  the man page.


version 0.5.8, 2008 Jun 20
==========================

Improved
--------

- `-c CONFIG_FILE` for feeding wtop and logrep custom configs
- Big speedup in `apache2unixtime()`
- Skips parsing of fields you don't ask for; nice performance boost there too.
  Credit to thwartedefforts.
- Support for nginx logs. You still have to set the `LOG_FORMAT` to the
  equivalent Apache format, but it works now with nginx's $request_time
  parameter. Credit to Igor S.
- Handles `%h` when Hostnamelookups is on in Apache. Hostnamelookups is usually
  not recommended, but you crazy kids want it, so it's there. Credit to Andrew
  Hedges (see `CONTRIBUTORS.rst`_)

.. _`CONTRIBUTORS.rst`:
   https://github.com/ClockworkNet/wtop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.rst

Deprecated or Known Issues
--------------------------

- The `usec` field (microsecond response time) is gone. Use `msec`
  (milliseconds) instead. This is for compatibility with nginx, but
  microseconds is ridiculous for timing a remote network transaction anyway.
- No support for multiple `LOG_FORMAT`\s yet. You can use the new -c option to
  get around this.
