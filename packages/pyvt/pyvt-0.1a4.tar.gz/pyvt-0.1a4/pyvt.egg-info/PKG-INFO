Description: pyvt
        ====
        
        Python 3 implementation of the
        `Virustotal <https://www.virustotal.com/>`__ `Private
        API <https://www.virustotal.com/en/documentation/private-api/>`__. In
        its current form it only implements a subset of the API and is
        incomplete.
        
        This module borrows code from, the
        `virustotal2 <https://github.com/Phillipmartin/virustotal2>`__ module.
        It uses the same rate limiting logic as virustotal2. Additionally it
        unifies the output of the API to json format and adds support for bulk
        queries.
        
        How To Use
        ----------
        
        ::
        
            import pyvt
        
            api = pyvt.API('~/.virustotal.key')
            # Retrieve list of ips
            api.retrieve(['173.236.179.77', '66.33.221.102'])
        
            # Retrieve list of urls
            api.retrieve(['http://3dtaller.com.ar/',
                          'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/jquery.loader.js',
                          'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-includes/js/swfobject.js',
                          'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/modernizr-2.0.js',
                          'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/custom.js',
                          'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/jquery-1.6.4.min.js'])
                          
            # Retrieve domain
            api.retrieve('3dtaller.com.ar')
        
        Installiation
        -------------
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install pyvt --pre
        
        Instantiation
        -------------
        
        ::
        
            api = pyvt.API('~/.virustotal.key')                                # The default way of using the 
            api = pyvt.API('', api_key=<VT API KEY>, limit_per_min=<number>)   # Providing other parameters
        
        You can pass limit\_per\_min, which is the number of queries you can
        perform per minute. 3000 is the default. You can also alternatively
        provide your api\_key as a string parameter.
        
        API
        ===
        
        Use the method retrieve() to get an existing report from VirusTotal.
        This method's first argument can be:
        
        -  a single or list of MD5, SHA1 or SHA256 of files
        -  a single or list of URLs
        -  a single or list IP addresses
        -  a single or list of domain names
        
        retrieve() will attempt to auto-detect what you're giving it. If you
        want to be explicit, you can use the thing\_type parameter with the
        values:
        
        -  ip
        -  domain
        -  hash
        -  file
        -  base64
        -  url
        
        These values are provided as constants that you can use instead in the
        'API\_Constans' class which you can import as follows ::
        
        ::
        
            from pyvt import API_Constansts
        
        You can use thee scan() method to scan specific URLs. The scan method
        currently only supports URLs and will through an exception if anything
        other than a url is given to it.
        
        Here is an example usage of the scan method that blocks until all scan
        results are available.
        
        ::
        
            response, fail = api.scan(['http://3dtaller.com.ar/',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/jquery.loader.js',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-includes/js/swfobject.js',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/modernizr-2.0.js',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/custom.js',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/jquery-1.6.4.min.js'], blocking=True)
                                           
        
        Here is another usage example of the scan method that is none blocking.
        
        ::
        
            response, fail = api.scan(['http://3dtaller.com.ar/',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/jquery.loader.js',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-includes/js/swfobject.js',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/modernizr-2.0.js',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/custom.js',
                                       'http://3dtaller.com.ar/wp-content/themes/theme1392/js/jquery-1.6.4.min.js'])
        
        With the non-blocking call you will need to use the 'retrieve' method to
        get the results of the scan at a later stage. Note that the 'scan'
        method will return a Tuple where the second element is the urls for
        which the Virustotal API returned a Failure status response code and the
        method will not attempt to submit again.
