`py_look_for_timeouts` looks for network calls without timeouts on them, using various heuristics. It knows and cares about urllib, httplib, twilio, and requests calls.

For a similar program which looks for SQL injection vulnerabilities, look at [py-find-injection](https://github.com/uber/py-find-injection)
