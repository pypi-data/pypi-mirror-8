Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        RedBaron is a query library for the
        `Baron <https://github.com/Psycojoker/baron>`__ Full Syntax Tree (FST).
        But what is Baron? Baron is a syntax tree, like an
        `AST <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree>`__ for the
        Python language that hold the following rule:
        syntax\_tree\_to\_code(code\_to\_syntax\_tree(code)) == code. The Baron
        FST is in form of JSON-serializable Python (list and dict) which is very
        low level and not extremely funny to work with (a bit like bytecode),
        RedBaron is an abstraction on top of that to ease the exploration and
        modification of this FST.
        
        Ok, but why this can be useful? The (hard) bet made by Baron is to
        induce a paradigm change in which writing code that explore or modify
        code (like (custom) refactoring code, refactoring browser, tooling,
        autoformattingâ€¦) is now a realistic task for most of the developers.
        Having a FST for Python means that the task of modifying source code
        just shift from parsing then modifying a string to modifying a
        meaningful tree. For a longer explanation `read
        this <https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/why.html>`__.
        
        **For now, RedBaron is in its early stages of development, it is quite
        stable but it is probably not the most shiny experience yet.** Feedback
        is very welcome.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2 (unreleased)
        ----------------
        
        - for EVERY NODE in RedBaron, the automagic behavior when passing a string to
          modify an attribute has been done, this is HUGE improvment
          https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modifying.html#full-documentations
        - it's now possible to use regex, globs, list/tuple  and lambda (callable) in .find and
          .find_all, see https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/querying.html#advanced-querying
        - new method on node: .replace() to replace in place a node
          https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/other.html#replace
        - .map .filter and .apply are now documented https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/other.html#map-filter-apply
        - .edit() new helper method to launch a text editor on the selected node and
          replace the node with the modified code https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/other.html#edit
        - .root node attribute (property) that return the root node of the tree in which the
          node is stored https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/other.html#root
        - .index node attribute (property) that returns the index at which the node is
          store if it's store in a nodelist, None otherwise https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/other.html#index
        - setitem (a[x] = b) on nodelist now works as expected (accepting string, fst
          node and redbaron node)
        - new method to handle indentation: .increase_indentation and .decrease_indentation https://redbaron.readthedocs.org/en/latest/other.html#increase-indentation-and-decrease-indentation
        - various small bugfix
        - we have one new contributor \o/ https://github.com/ze42
        - to_node has been move to a class method of Node: Node.from_fst
        - pretty print of nodes when using redbaron in a script
