Description: Book Binder
        ===========
        
        Book Binder is an ePub generation tool. It generates an ePub book from
        Google Documents and/or markdown files located in a Google Drive folder.
        When the content of your book is ready at a Google Drive folder (either
        as Google Documents or as markdown files) you can use Book Binder to
        convert that folder into an ePub. Book Binder requires a metadata file
        (in form of a Google Spreadsheet) to be able to successfully populate
        the ePub metadata.

        ::
        
          bookbinder FOLDER-ID
        
        Where ``FOLDER-ID`` is the ID of your Google Drive folder. Once you
        authenticate, it will start downloading, processing and packing of the
        files. For help, and usage information, type ``bookbinder -h``.

        makes your life easier once you get the grip of it.
