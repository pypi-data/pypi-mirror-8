    Generates a uniform set of information out of the supplied data and does

                     from the related model into a lookup cache, so that less
                     database queries will be made.
    :param assign_by_id: This will assign the related objects as Primary Key
                         values (int) instead of whole objects. This
                         decreases the memory usage but has a drawback, because
