Description: Testify is a replacement for Python's unittest module.
  It is modeled after unittest, and tests written for unittest will run under testify with a minimum
  of adjustments, but it has features above and beyond unittest:
    - class-level setup and teardown fixture methods which are run once each for an entire set of test methods.
    - a decorator-based approach for fixture methods, eliminating the need for super() calls.
    - More pythonic, less java-unittest
    - enhanced test discovery - testify can drill down into packages to find test cases.
    - support for collecting and running tests by 'tagging' modules, classes or methods.
    - A decorator-based approach to temporarily disabling certain tests, which strongly encourages documentation and eventual fixing of bugs.
    - Pretty test runner output (color!)
    - Client-server support
Python-Version: >=2.5
