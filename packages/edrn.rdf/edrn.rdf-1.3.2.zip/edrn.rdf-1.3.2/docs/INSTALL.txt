edrn.rdf Installation
=====================

Use zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your
project, and do the following:

* Add ``edrn.rdf`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        edrn.rdf
    
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
    
You don't need a ZCML slug because it uses z3c.autoinclude.plugin with the
Plone target.
