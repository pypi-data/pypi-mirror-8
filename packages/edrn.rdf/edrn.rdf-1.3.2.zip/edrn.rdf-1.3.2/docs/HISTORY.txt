Changelog
=========

What follows is a log of changes from release to release.  Where issue
identifiers appear, you can find more about them by visiting this project's
issue tracker at https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA.


1.3.2 — Ontology 1.8
--------------------

This release sets up additional predicate handlers and is compatible with the
SOAP Ontology API 1.8.


1.3.1 — I Had Some Chicken; Pass the FLOSS
------------------------------------------

This package is now free, open source software under the Apache License v2.


1.3.0 — Texas-Sized
-------------------

• Compatible with RDFLib 4.0.1
• Compatible with Plone 4.3.2
• Compatible with zc.buildout 2.2.1
• Compatible with EDRN Ontology 1.8
• Compatible with DMCC Web Services (test tier) as of 20140401


1.2.3 — Protocols Without Publications
--------------------------------------

The DMCC's SOAP service always lists a slot for publications even when a
protocol has no publications.  But in RDF, we don't want make any statement
about publications when there aren't any.  This release addresses that.


1.2.2 — Upgrades
----------------

This release addresses the following:

* Compatible with RDFLib 3.2.3
* Compatible with Plone 4.2.2


1.2.1 — Links
-------------

This release addresses the following:

* CA-1031 - New RDF server fails to link protocols correctly


1.2.0 — Webbed
--------------

This release drops the SQL Server access and uses the DMCC's SOAP services
instead.


1.1.3 — Ahoy Skipper
--------------------

This release updates the tunnel to contact the DMCC's SQL Server database on
its new home, skipper.fhcrc.org.

* CA-957 - DMCC SQL Server for dbEKE password is no longer valid


1.1.2 — Release Early, Release Often
------------------------------------

This release fixes the default password for the EKE database.  (We should
really just make this a parameter on a control panel, except we're supposed to
switch over to the ws_newcompass webservice anyway.)


1.1.1 — Default Database Deliberation
-------------------------------------

This release uses the database on ``localhost`` by default, since that's the
point of combining the RDF server with the tunneled backend deployment.


1.1.0 — Upgrade Containerize
----------------------------

This release makes edrn.rdf compatible with:

* Zope 2.13
* Plone 4.1
* plone.testing 4.0.2

It also prepares the RDF server for decommissioning on ginger.fhcrc.org and
relocating at the EDRN Informatics Center.


1.0.0 - Committees
------------------

The following are addressed in this release:

* Physical, mailing, and shipping addresses are no longer provided for each
  EDRN site.  The DMCC removed all of them from the EKE database.  However,
  they did add a single address to registered people.  As a result, this
  release drops addresses from sites and adds them to people.
* Committees.  RDF feeds for the list of committees, their types, and their
  members are now available.


0.0.11 - Author! Author!
------------------------

The RDF feed for EDRN publications has had absolutely no author information in
it.  And yet no one noticed until today!  So, this release fixes that issue.

By the way, if you're curious, you can see details about the issue at the
following location: https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-582


0.0.10 - PyMSSQL Lockdown
-------------------------

This package depends on the Python Microsoft SQL Server library known as
"pymssql", but never specified a version of the library to use.  The latest
version available was just fine for quite some time.

Until today.

Today, pymssql 1.9.905.1 was suddenly available, and it doesn't build.  So,
we're locking ourselves down to pymssql version 1.0.2, which does build and
works just fine for what we need.


0.0.9 - Account Names
---------------------

The DMCC now provides user account names for registered people.  This release
supports that by providing a place to specify the URI to the RDF predicate,
and the RDF export uses that URI to state the account names of people who have
accounts.


0.0.8 - Official EKE Database
-----------------------------

This release updates the database server changing it from pongo to compass1.
The new server, compass1, hosts the official RDF source information and
contains no funky testing data like "Greg's Cool Protocol".


0.0.7 - Protocol Types and Eligibility Criteria
-----------------------------------------------

Greg Warnick has added additional data to the DMCC RDF database, comprising
the two following new slots:

* ``Elibility_critera`` describing eligibility criteria of a protocol
* ``Protocol_type``, what we thought was once long lost, is back!

This release of the RDF_ Server provides these two additional fields.
Additionally, it updates its test data and function test battery.


0.0.6 - Investigators and Staff Strike Back
-------------------------------------------

The "Site" view within the DMCC RDF database has gotten tons of action
recently.  It's changed as follows:

* ``Site_Specialty_Description`` is now called ``Site_Program_Description``
* New field: ``IDs_for_Investigators``
* New field: ``IDs_for_CoInvestigators``
* New field: ``IDs_for_CoPrincipalInvestigator``

In addition, the ``Registered_Person`` view gained four new fields:

* ``Fax``
* ``Specialty``
* ``Photo``
* ``EDRN_Title``

Therefore, this release of the EDRN_ RDF_ Server accommodates these updates.
In addition, it also updates its battery of tests and test data.


0.0.5 - Investigators and Staff
-------------------------------

The "Site" view within the DMCC RDF database now provides primary
investigators, co-investigators, and other staff members at each site.  This
release updates the Site RDF_ generation to include such details.


0.0.4 - Database Correction
---------------------------

Release 0.0.3 got away with a test database setting still set.  This release
corrects that and uses the correct source of RDF data.


0.0.3 - Registered People
-------------------------

This release of EDRN_ RDF_ Server provides a new data source: registered
people.  Registered people are people known to EDRN.  This data source
provides RDF descriptions of EDRN people.  In addition, it also fixes the
following issues:

* CA-296: Site-Specific URI Prefix missing on Protocol control panel.  Added
  it in r4905.
* CA-285: Numeric fields of research replaced with actual names; r4906.
* CA-264: Export registered people; r4907.

In addition, we've reduced the amount of test data and made the unit tests run
a lot faster.


0.0.2 - New DB Structure
------------------------

This release of the EDRN_  RDF_  Server accommodates the new DMCC database
structure, particularly for diseases and protocols.  Specifically, it
addresses these issues:

* CA-252: http://ginger.fhcrc.org/dmcc/rdf-data/diseases/rdf produces error
* CA-253: http://ginger.fhcrc.org/dmcc/rdf-data/protocols/rdf produces error

In addition, it updates the functional tests' test database.

0.0.1 - Protocols
-----------------

This release of the EDRN_  RDF_  Server includes implementation of RDF service
for EDRN Protocols and Studies as tracked by the Data Management and
Coordinating Center (DMCC).

In addition, this release contains:

* Fixes to the layout of control panel pages for Body Systems, Diseases,
  Publications, and Site RDF sources.
* Addition of a download URL to the PyPI package data.
* Updates to the functional tests' test database.


0.0.0 - Unreleased
------------------

* Initial release
