        **************************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `angular infiniteScroll`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`angular infiniteScroll`: https://sroze.github.io/ngInfiniteScroll
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.angular_infinite_scroll``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``infinite_scroll`` from ``js.angular_infinite_scroll`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.angular_infinite_scroll import infinite_scroll
          >>> infinite_scroll.need()
