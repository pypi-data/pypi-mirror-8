        bpssl
        ================
        
        bpssl is a Django application that helps you support
        HTTPS on your website. The main functionality is performing redirection
        for HTTPS only URLs and views. For instance, if a request for your
        login view '/login' is recieved over HTTP, the provided middleware can
        redirect the user to the equivalent HTTPS page.
        
        Specifying views and urls as secure is supported as are `flatpages`_. `Fastcgi`_
        and HTTP proxy setups are also well supported. See the documentation at:

        bpssl draws inspiration from the well known SSL Middleware snippets on
        djangosnippets.org. It roughly supports the features of the following
        snippets:

        Middleware
        =====================
        
        bpssl provides an ``SSLRedirectMiddleware`` which can redirect users from
        secure pages to non-secure pages and visa-versa. Urls are set up by adding
        regular expressions to the ``SSL_URLS`` setting in settings.py.
        ``SSLRedirectMiddleware`` can also be extended to support more specific use
        cases.
        
        ssl_view decorator
        =====================
        
        bpssl provides an ``ssl_view()`` decorator which can be used instead of the
        ``SSL_URLS`` to specify that a particular view should be secure.

        Development
        =====================
        
        Generally you will want to develop bpssl in a virtualenv with pip::
        
            $ mkvirtualenv bpssl
        
        You can install the requirements using the requirements.txt and pip::
            
            $ pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
        
        And run tests normally using setup.py::
        
            $ python setup.py test
