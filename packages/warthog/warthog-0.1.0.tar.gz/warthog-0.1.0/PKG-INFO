Description: Warthog
        =======
        
        A simple Python client for A10 load balancers
        
        **WARNING** - This is pre-alpha software and subject to breaking changes and/or bugs.
        
        Warthog is a simple Python client for interacting with A10 load balancers. The target
        use case is for safely removing servers from pools in a load balancer during a deployment.
        
        Since the target use case is only aimed at deployments, Warthog supports far fewer types
        of operations than something like the `official <https://github.com/a10networks/acos-client>`_
        client.
        
        Features
        --------
        * Waiting for servers to finish all requests when being disabled
        * Graceful handling of transient errors with optional retry logic
        * Support for interacting with the load balancer API using SSL
        * Python 2.6 -- 3.4
        * Thread safety
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install Warthog, simply run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install warthog
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Using the client is easy!
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from warthog.api import WarthogClient
        
            client = WarthogClient('https://lb.example.com', 'user', 'password')
        
            client.disable_server('app1.example.com')
            # Install something on the server or restart your application
            client.enable_server('app1.example.com')
        
            # Or, use the client as a context manager!
        
            with client.disabled_context('app1.example.com'):
                # install something on the server or restart your application
                pass
