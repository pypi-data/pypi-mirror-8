Help

::

    $ dennis-cmd lint --help

This will list the available lint rules and codes, the variable
formats and any additional options available.


Summary
=======

Dennis can lint your translated ``.po`` files for Python formatting
token issues::

    $ dennis-cmd lint messages.po


This runs multiple lint rules on all the strings in the ``.po`` file
generating a list of errors and a list of warnings.

Wait, but that's ugly and hard to read! If you install ``blessings``, it
comes colorized and really easy to parse. All hail blessings!

Dennis can also lint your ``.pot`` files and point out issues that can
result in poor translations. You can lint ``.pot`` files like this::

    $ dennis-cmd lint messages.pot


Skipping rules string-by-string
===============================

In the extracted comment, you can tell Dennis to ignore lint rules (or
all lint rules).

Ignore everything::

    #. dennis-ignore: *
    msgid "German makes up 10% of our visitor base"
    msgstr "A német a látogatóbázisunk 10%-át teszi ki"

Ignore specific rules (comma-separated)::

    #. dennis-ignore: E101,E102,E103
    msgid "German makes up 10% of our visitor base"
    msgstr "A német a látogatóbázisunk 10%-át teszi ki"

Ignore everything, but note the beginning of the line is ignored by
Dennis so you can tell localizers to ignore the ignore thing::

    #. localizers--ignore this comment. dennis-ignore: *
    msgid "German makes up 10% of our visitor base"
    msgstr "A német a látogatóbázisunk 10%-át teszi ki"


Warnings and Errors
===================

What's a warning?
-----------------

Warnings indicate the translated string is either outdated or a poor
translation, but the string is fine in the sense that it won't kick
up an error in production.

For example, say the original string has a variable, but the
translated string doesn't use that variable.

That's not great and probably means the translated string needs to be
updated, but it won't throw an error in production.


What's an error?
----------------

Errors indicate problems with the translated string that will cause
an error to be thrown. These should get fixed pronto.

For example, when the translated string has a Python variable that's
not in the original string. When this string is interpolated, it will
kick up a Python error. That causes the software to die, users to be
unhappy, tires to go flat, people to work on weekends, mass hysteria,
etc. No one likes that. I don't like that. You probably don't like
that, either.

| W502 | Multiple unnamed variables                                            |
|      |                                                                       |
|      | Having one unnamed variable is ok since it's not order-dependent.     |
|      | However, having more than one unnamed variable means those variabes   |
|      | must occur in an order specified outside of the string. This creates  |
|      | problems with RTL languages and any other language that might need to |
|      | change the order of the variables to create a translation that makes  |
|      | sense.                                                                |
