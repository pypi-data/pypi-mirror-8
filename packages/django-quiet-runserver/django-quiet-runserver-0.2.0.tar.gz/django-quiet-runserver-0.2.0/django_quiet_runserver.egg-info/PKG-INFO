Description: ======================
        django-quiet-runserver
        ======================
        
        A quieter version of the default Django ``runserver``.
        
        The default ``runserver`` prints out a *lot* of information,
        and not all of it is useful.
        This packages removes most of the information printed,
        leaving only the important stuff:
        
        - Requests to some static assets are not logged
        - ``304 Not Modified`` requests are not logged
        - Timestamps are no longer included. Most of the time, these are noise
        - The common response types ``GET`` and ``POST``
          are abbreviated to ``G`` and ``P``
        - ``GET`` query strings are logged on a separate, slightly indented line,
          allowing for easy differentiation.
        
        
        Example::
        
            200 G /
            200 G /static/styles.css
            200 G /search/
              ?q=foo&sort=date
            200 G /item/123/
            301 P /item/123/
            200 G /item/123/
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Install this package::
        
            pip install djangoquietrunserver
        
        Include it in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'djangoquietrunserver',
            )
        
        Using
        -----
        
        Use ``runserver--`` instead of ``runserver``::
        
            python manage.py runserver--
        
        Monkey patching
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you do not want to use ``runserver--``, you can monkey patch Django so that
        the default ``runserver`` will use the quieter logging by default. If you're
        running Django 1.7 or above, use the following in your INSTALLED_APPS instead::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'djangoquietrunserver.apps.MonkeypatchConfig',
            )
        
        If you're running an older version of Django, enable the monkeypatch by adding
        the following lines to your ``manage.py``, just after the ``import sys`` line::
        
            import djangoquietrunserver.monkeypatch
            djangoquietrunserver.monkeypatch()
