Description: pyLibrary
        =========
        
        A library of wonderful things!
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Python is a Little Crufty
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Python is awesome now, but it was originally a procedural language
        invented before functional semantics, before OO, and even before the
        discovery of vowels. As a consequence there are many procedures that
        alter their own parameters, or have disemvoweled names. This library
        puts a facade over these relics of the past and uses convention to name
        methods.
        
        Advanced List Comprehensions are Awesome
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        My career has been permeated with the need to write `ETL
        scripts <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load>`__. I
        have preferred SQL for it's succinctness when dealing with data
        transformations, and it makes Python's list comprehensions look limited
        in comparison. I have added a few more relational operators, and
        provided procedures to handle common complex list comprehensions.
        
        Nones are Important
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ETL inherently deals with diverse data and missing data. This leaves
        many opportunities for None to take the place of that missing data.
        
        Heavy use of list comprehensions requires a significantly different
        strategy when dealing with Nulls/Nones. The Pythonic strategy of raising
        exceptions on invalid access is unacceptable inside the context of list
        operations because we want to process all good data and not exit early.
        Furthermore, even the data with Nones can go through partial processing.
        
        A significant portion of this library implements familiar set/list
        operations while dealing with Nones gracefully. To do this, None is
        interpreted as *not-applicable* rather than *unknown/missing*. The
        former allows operations to assume the None can be ignored in the
        context of the operation, and this assumption turns out to be mostly
        correct in the context of ETL. The latter interpretation appears more in
        statistics. A good example is ``util.collections.AND``:
        
        ::
        
            AND(True, None, True) == True  # Assuming None means "not applicable"
            AND(True, None, True) == None  # Assuming None means "unknown"
        
        JSON is Everywhere
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This library is also designed to query into hierarchical data, like
        JSON. Hierarchical queries are made easy by manipulating references to
        paths into the JSON trees, and further allowing set comprehensions to
        use those paths to deconstruct, or reconstruct trees succinctly. The dot
        "``.``\ " operator is used to specify paths, and is so prevalent that
        the literal dot must be escaped (like so: "``\.``\ "). JSON, and the
        paths into it, are an excellent source of Nones.
        
        Structured Logging integrated with Chained Exceptions is Good
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Exception handling and logging are undeniably linked. There are many
        instances where exceptions are raised and must be logged, except when
        they are appropriately handled. The greatness of exception handling
        semantics comes from decoupling the cause from the solution, but this is
        at odds with clean logging - which couples raising and handling to make
        appropriate decisions about what to ultimately emit to the log. For this
        reason, the logging module is responsible for collecting the trace and
        context, raising the exception, and then deducing if there is something
        that will handle it (so it can be ignored), or if it really must be
        logged.
        
        This library also expects all log messages and exception messages to
        have named parameters so they can be stored in easy-to-digest JSON,
        which can be processed by downstream tools.
        
        Windows 7 Install Instructions for Python
        -----------------------------------------
        
        Python was really made for Linux, and installation will be easier there.
        Technically, Python works on Windows too, but there are a few gotchas
        you can avoid by following these instructions.
        
        -  Download Python 2.7 (32bit ONLY!!! Many native libs are 32 bit)
        -  Install Python at ``c:\Python27`` (The space in the "Program Files"
           may screw up installs of native libs)
        -  Add to you path: ``c:\Python27;c:\Python27\scripts;``
        -  Download ``http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py``
        
           ::
        
               CALL python distribute_setup.py
               CALL easy_install pip
               CALL easy_install virtualenv
        
        -  Many "Python Powered" native installs require a pointer to the python
           installation, but they have no idea where to look in 64bit windows.
           You must alter the registry
           (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3652625/installing-setuptools-on-64-bit-windows):
        
           ::
        
               SET HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Python\PythonCore\2.7\InstallPath = "C:\Python27"
        
        Using virtualenv
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``virtualenv`` allows you to have multiple python projects on the same
        machine, even if they use different versions of the same libraries.
        ``virtualenv`` does this by making a copy of the main python directory
        and using it to hold the specific versions required.
        
        -  New environment: ``virtualenv <name_of_dir>``
        -  Activate environment: ``<name_of_dir>\scripts\activate``
        -  Exit environment: ``deactivate``
        
        If you have more than one project on your dev box I suggest you do all
        your work inside a virtual environment.
        
        Binaries and Virtual Environments
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you plan to use any binary packages, ``virtualenv`` will not work
        directly. Instead, install the binary (32 bit only!!) to the main python
        installation. Then copy any newly installed files/directories from
        ``C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages`` to ``<name_of_dir>\Lib\site-packages``
        
        Installing pyLibrary
        --------------------
        
        Once Python is installed, other Python packages are are much easier.
        
        -  Install from PyPi:
        
           ::
        
               pip install pyLibrary
        
        Installing for Development
        --------------------------
        
        -  Download from Github:
        
           ::
        
               git clone https://github.com/klahnakoski/pyLibrary.git
        
        -  Install requirements:
        
           ::
        
               python setup.py develop
