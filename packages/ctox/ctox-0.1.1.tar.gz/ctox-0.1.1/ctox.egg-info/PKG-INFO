        `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/>`__ but with conda.
        
        |Build Status|
        
        This is a really rough hack to replicate tox using conda, you'll be much
        better off using tox (tox is *professionally supported* whilst ctox
        isn't supported). In the long-term a much better solution is to add
        conda support to tox...
        
        Currently:
        
        -  conda envs and dependancies are cached (naively)
        -  some tox substitutions (lots of missing features)
        -  no cli options
        -  no parallel support (see above)
        -  bugs (probably lots)
        
        However, the neat thing is that it makes tox-like testing on a machine
        with conda installed but not all python versions (e.g. no native python
        3). Potentially this might also be useful for the scientific python
        stack...
        
        In conclusion, don't use this, here be :dragon:s.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Have conda installed on your system. The recommended way (I think) is
        via `miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`__, the not
        recommended way (which will almost certainly fail) is via pip, please
        don't use this with conda installed via pip.
        
        In the project's directory (which has a ``tox.ini`` file):
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cd project_dir
            ctox
        
        Why
        ---
        
        I was sick of ``InterpreterNotFound`` when trying to use tox having
        installed python with conda. This solves that neatly and I thought it
        wouldn't take very long to put together. No doubt I should've just
        hacked on tox, but there you are!
        
        Why not?
