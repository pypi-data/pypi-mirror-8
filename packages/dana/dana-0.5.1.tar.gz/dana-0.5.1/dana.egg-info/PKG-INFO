Description: 
        DANA (Distributed (asynchronous) Numerical and Adaptive computing) is a python
        computing framework based on numpy and scipy libraries whose primary goals
        relate to computational neuroscience and artificial neural networks. However,
        this framework can be used in several different areas like physic simulations,
        cellular automata or image processing.
        
        The computational paradigm supporting the DANA framework is grounded on the
        notion of a unit that is a set of arbitrary values that can vary along time
        under the influence of other units and learning. Each unit can be linked to any
        other unit (including itself) using a weighted link and a group is a structured
        set of such homogeneous units.
