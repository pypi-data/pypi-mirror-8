DANA, Distributed (Asynchronous) Adaptive Numerical Computing Framework
=======================================================================

Overview
--------
DANA is a python computing framework based on numpy and scipy libraries whose
primary goals relate to computational neuroscience and artificial neural
networks. However, this framework can be used in several different areas like
physic simulations, cellular automata or image processing. The computational
paradigm supporting the dana framework is grounded on the notion of a unit that
is a set of arbitrary values that can vary along time under the influence of
other units and learning. Each unit can be linked to any other unit (including
itself) using a weighted connection and a group is a structured set of such
homogeneous units.
