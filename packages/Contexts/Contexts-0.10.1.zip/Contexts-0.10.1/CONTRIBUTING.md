I keep my to-do list [on Trello](https://trello.com/b/uPgp50AF/contexts-development).
If you want to contribute to the project, anything in the 'To-Do' list with
a 'bug' or 'quick-fix' label is probably a good place to start.
Many of these features can be implemented fairly straightforwardly by writing a new plugin.

Another good way of getting up to speed with the project would be to contribute to the
[documentation](https://github.com/benjamin-hodgson/Contexts/tree/master/doc).

If you want to do something from the 'Ideas' list, you feel one
of the tasks requires more elaboration, or you want some help with the code-base,
you're welcome to [contact me via email](mailto:benjamin.hodgson@huddle.com).

Contexts is developed using Test-Driven-Development. Any new features should have
accompanying tests (written with Contexts) - see [the existing tests](https://github.com/benjamin-hodgson/Contexts/tree/master/test) for examples.

Once your feature is finished and tested, simply submit a pull request to this repository.
