        =========
        
        Optunity is a library containing various optimizers for hyperparameter tuning.
        Hyperparameter tuning is a recurrent problem in many machine learning tasks,
        both supervised and unsupervised. Tuning examples include optimizing 
        regularization or kernel parameters.
        
        From an optimization point of view, the tuning problem can be considered as 
        follows: the objective function is non-convex, non-differentiable and 
        typically expensive to evaluate.
        
        This package provides several distinct approaches to solve such problems including 
        some helpful facilities such as cross-validation and a plethora of score functions.
        
        The Optunity library is implemented in Python and allows straightforward
        integration in other machine learning environments, including R and MATLAB.
        
        To get started with Optunity on Linux, issue the following commands::
        
            git clone https://github.com/claesenm/optunity.git
            echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/optunity" >> ~/.bashrc
        
        Afterwards, importing ``optunity`` should work in Python::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            import optunity
        
        Optunity is developed at the STADIUS lab of the dept. of electrical engineering
        at KU Leuven (ESAT). Optunity is free software, using a BSD license.
