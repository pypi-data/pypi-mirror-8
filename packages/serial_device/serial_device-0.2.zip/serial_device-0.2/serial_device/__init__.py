    This class provides a base interface for encapsulating interaction with a
    device connected through a serial-port.

    It provides methods to automatically resolve a port based on an
    implementation-defined connection-test, which is applied to all available
    serial-ports until a successful connection is made.

    Notes
    =====

    This class intends to be cross-platform and has been verified to work on
    Windows and Ubuntu.
