Description: 
        A pure python binary tree class is provided.  It is
        thoroughly unit tested, passes pylint, and is known
        to run on CPython 2.x, CPython 3.x, Pypy 2.4.0, Pypy3 2.4.0 and
        Jython 2.7b3.
        
        This binary tree looks like a dictionary that's always
        sorted by key.  It does not reorganize itself.
        
        Although definitely a poor choice for pre-sorted keys, it's quite
        good for pre-randomized keys.
