Description: 
        Pony is an object-relational mapper. The most interesting feature of Pony is
        its ability to write queries to the database using generator expressions.
        Pony works with entities which are mapped to a SQL database. Using generator
        syntax for writing queries allows the user to formulate very eloquent queries.
        It increases the level of abstraction and allows a programmer to concentrate
        on the business logic of the application. For this purpose Pony analyzes the
        abstract syntax tree of a generator and translates it to its SQL equivalent.
        
        Following is an example of a query in Pony:
        
            select(p for p in Product if p.name.startswith('A') and p.cost <= 1000)
        
        Pony translates queries to SQL using a specific database dialect.
        Currently Pony works with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases.
        
        The package pony.orm.examples contains several examples.
