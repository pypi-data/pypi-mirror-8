Description: Tunic
        =====
        
        Tunic is a library built on Fabric for performing common tasks related
        to deploying a code base on multiple remote servers.
        
        It's designed so that you can make use of as much or as little of
        its functionality as you'd like, the choice is yours.
        
        It only requires the Fabric library as a dependency and can be installed
        from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using the pip tool like so.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install tunic
        
        You could then make use of it in your deploy process like so.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from fabric.api import task
            from tunic.api import get_release_id, ReleaseManager, VirtualEnvInstallation
        
            APP_BASE = '/srv/www/myapp'
        
            @task
            def deploy():
                stop_my_app()
                release = get_release_id()
        
                installer = VirtualEnvInstaller(APP_BASE, ['myapp'])
                release_manager = ReleaseManager(APP_BASE)
        
                installer.install(release)
                release_manager.set_current_release(release)
        
                start_my_app()
        
        The above snippet is just the start, take a look around the code base
        for more methods that can save you work in your deploy process.
