pysqlcipher
===========

This library is a fork of pysqlite.
It is still in beta state (although it's strongly used in development in some
linux environments). It links against against libsqlcipher.

Usage
-----
You have to pass the ``PRAGMA key`` before doing any operations::

  from pysqlcipher import dbapi2 as sqlite
  conn = sqlite.connect('test.db')
  c = conn.cursor()
  c.execute("PRAGMA key='test'")
  c.execute('''create table stocks (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)''')
  c.execute("""insert into stocks values ('2006-01-05','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)""")
  conn.commit()
  c.close()

You can quickly verify that your database file in indeed encrypted::

  hexdump -C test.db

Build against libsqlcipher
--------------------------

For convenience, this package uses a sqlcipher amalgamation during the regular
install. See https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html

For production use, you should build against ``libsqlcipher`` installed in your
system, you can do it like this::

  python setup.py build_sqlcipher

And then::

  python setup.py install
