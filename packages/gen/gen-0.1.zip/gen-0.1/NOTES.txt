Internal format of a template
=============================

A template is a list of items. Each item is a dictionary with the following
elements:

  - name: the file name (directories are created as needed)
  - directory: boolean, is this file a directory?
  - encoding: the encoding of the file content (not used if content is binary)
  - content: the file content
  - executable: boolean, set the executable bit?
  - binary: boolean, is the file binary?
  - renderer: a function to update the content before writing, for example
    - jinja2 render
    - base64 decode

Obtaining template items
========================

Template items can come from:

  - A YAML format definition
  - A set of files on the filesystem
  - A set of files from a zip file

Rendering content
=================

Content can be rendered in a number of ways:

  - Direct copy of the data into the filesystem
  - Jinja2 templating

File and directory names need rendering as well.

Variables
=========

Variables are defined in the template, and may be supplied by any of the
following methods:

  - As parameters in internal API calls
  - As arguments from the command line
  - As interactive user input (prompted)
  - From a configuration file
    - Global
    - Per-user
    - Per-template (possibly, maybe have template name glob matching, maybe YAGNI)
