The ``pip-accel`` program is a wrapper for pip_, the Python package manager. It
accelerates the usage of ``pip`` to initialize `Python virtual environments`_
given one or more `requirements files`_. It does so by combining the following
two approaches:

1. Source distribution downloads are cached and used to generate a `local index
   of source distribution archives`_. If all your dependencies are pinned to
   absolute versions whose source distribution downloads were previously
   cached, ``pip-accel`` won't need a network connection at all! This is one of
   the reasons why ``pip`` can be so slow: given absolute pinned dependencies
   available in the download cache it will still scan PyPI_ and distribution
   websites.

2. `Binary distributions`_ are used to speed up the process of installing
   dependencies with binary components (like M2Crypto_ and LXML_). Instead of
   recompiling these dependencies again for every virtual environment we
   compile them once and cache the result as a binary ``*.tar.gz``
   distribution.

In addition, since version 0.9 ``pip-accel`` contains a simple mechanism that
detects missing system packages when a build fails and prompts the user whether
to install the missing dependencies and retry the build.

The ``pip-accel`` program is tested on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.4 although support
for Python 3 is very new so may still have some issues.

Status
------

Paylogic_ uses ``pip-accel`` to quickly and reliably initialize virtual
environments on its farm of continuous integration slaves which are constantly
running unit tests (this was one of the original use cases for which
``pip-accel`` was developed). We also use it on our build servers.

When ``pip-accel`` was originally developed PyPI_ was sometimes very unreliable
(PyPI wasn't `behind a CDN`_ back then). Because of the CDN, PyPI is much more
reliable nowadays however ``pip-accel`` still has its place:

- The CDN doesn't help for distribution sites, which are as unreliably as they
  have always been.

- By using ``pip-accel`` you can make Python deployments completely independent
  from internet connectivity.

- Because ``pip-accel`` caches compiled binary packages it can still provide a
  nice speed boost over using plain ``pip``.

Usage
-----

The ``pip-accel`` command supports all subcommands and options supported by
``pip``, however it is of course only useful for the ``pip install``
subcommand. So for example::

   pip-accel install -r requirements.txt

If you pass a `-v` or `--verbose` option then ``pip`` and ``pip-accel`` will
both use verbose output. The `q` or `--quiet` option is also supported.

Based on the user running ``pip-accel`` the following file locations are used
by default:

=============================  =========================  =======================================
Root user                      All other users            Purpose
=============================  =========================  =======================================
``/root/.pip/download-cache``  ``~/.pip/download-cache``  Assumed to be pip's download cache
``/var/cache/pip-accel``       ``~/.pip-accel``           Used to store the source/binary indexes
=============================  =========================  =======================================

These defaults can be overridden by defining the environment variables
``PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` and/or ``PIP_ACCEL_CACHE``.

How fast is it?
---------------

To give you an idea of how effective ``pip-accel`` is, below are the results of
a test to build a virtual environment for one of the internal code bases of
Paylogic_. This code base requires more than 40 dependencies including several
packages that need compilation with SWIG and a C compiler:

=========  ================================  ===========  ===============
Program    Description                       Duration     Percentage
=========  ================================  ===========  ===============
pip        Default configuration             444 seconds  100% (baseline)
pip        With download cache (first run)   416 seconds  94%
pip        With download cache (second run)  318 seconds  72%
pip-accel  First run                         397 seconds  89%
pip-accel  Second run                        30 seconds   7%
=========  ================================  ===========  ===============

Dependencies on system packages
-------------------------------

Since version 0.9 ``pip-accel`` contains a simple mechanism that detects
missing system packages when a build fails and prompts the user whether to
install the missing dependencies and retry the build. Currently only Debian
Linux and derivative Linux distributions are supported, although support for
other platforms should be easy to add. This functionality currently works based
on configuration files that define dependencies of Python packages on system
packages. This means the results should be fairly reliable, but every single
dependency needs to be manually defined...

Here's what it looks like in practice::

Control flow of pip-accel
-------------------------

The way ``pip-accel`` works is not very intuitive but it is very effective.
Below is an overview of the control flow. Once you take a look at the code
you'll notice that the steps below are all embedded in a loop that retries
several times. This is mostly because of step 2 (downloading the source
distributions).

1. Run ``pip install --no-index --no-install -r requirements.txt`` to unpack
   source distributions available in the local source index. This is the first
   step because ``pip-accel`` should accept ``requirements.txt`` files as input
   but it will manually install dependencies from cached binary distributions
   (without using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``):

  - If the command succeeds it means all dependencies are already available as
    downloaded source distributions. We'll parse the verbose pip output of step
    1 to find the direct and transitive dependencies (names and versions)
    defined in ``requirements.txt`` and use them as input for step 3. Go to
    step 3.

  - If the command fails it probably means not all dependencies are available
    as local source distributions yet so we should download them. Go to step 2.

2. Run ``pip install --no-install -r requirements.txt`` to download missing
   source distributions to the download cache:

  - If the command fails it means that pip encountered errors while scanning
    PyPI_, scanning a distribution website, downloading a source distribution
    or unpacking a source distribution. Usually these kinds of errors are
    intermittent so retrying a few times is worth a shot. Go to step 2.

  - If the command succeeds it means all dependencies are now available as
    local source distributions; we don't need the network anymore! Go to step 1.

3. Run ``python setup.py bdist_dumb --format=gztar`` for each dependency that
   doesn't have a cached binary distribution yet (taking version numbers into
   account). Go to step 4.

4. Install all dependencies from binary distributions based on the list of
   direct and transitive dependencies obtained in step 1. We have to do these
   installations manually because ``easy_install`` nor ``pip`` support binary
   ``*.tar.gz`` distributions.
