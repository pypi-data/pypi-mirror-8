        ===========
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.civicrm
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.civicrm`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        .. Note::
        
            You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
        
        Before you begin
        ----------------
        
        To use the CiviCRM integration you need the following information:
        
        - REST interface URL
        - Site key
        - Every user that will interact with CiviCRM needs an API key
        
        See `CiviCRM REST interface documentation`_ for more information on this.
