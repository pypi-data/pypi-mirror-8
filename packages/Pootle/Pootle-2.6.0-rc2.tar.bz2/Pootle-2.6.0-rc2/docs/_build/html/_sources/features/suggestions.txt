Translation suggestions
=======================

Pootle has the ability to optionally allow users to provide suggestions that
need to be reviewed before they are accepted into the real translation files.
Who is allowed to do what, is determined by the configuration of
:doc:`permissions` for the project or the server.

This allows for a team to form with different roles for different team members,
and makes it possible to have a more explicit review step that requires
suggestions to be checked before they become the real translations. This also
allows the collection of different ideas for translating a single string.

Viewing and making suggestions
------------------------------

When translating, suggestions are shown inline so they're always visible. If a
user wants to view all the suggestions within a project scope, it just needs to
go to the "Review" tab and click on the "View Suggestions" link. Users with
rights to translate will be shown a "Review Suggestions" link and will be able
to accept and reject suggestions.

Users with rights for making suggestions will see a "Suggest" button next to
"Submit". Making a suggestions is as easy as clicking the button -- hey, did
you expect more steps involved?


.. _suggestions#reviewing:

Reviewing suggestions
---------------------

In order to review suggestions, users must have privileges to translate. There
are two ways for reviewing suggestions: going through all of them, or reviewing
while translating.

To go through all of them, the reviewer must click on "Review Suggestions"
within the "Review" tab of the project. This would guide her/him through all
the suggestions available for the current view.

The second method is straightforward, since suggestions are shown throughout
the translation process. Additionally, buttons for accepting and rejecting the
suggestions are displayed.

While reviewing a suggestion, a coloured difference between the current
translation and the suggestion is displayed. If available, the username is
provided of the user that gave the suggestion.

A click on the green tick icon approves the selected suggestion while the red
cross rejects the selected suggestion. A suggestion approval doesn't imply the
rejection of the remaining suggestions.
