This module contains the main function "LIS" plus 2 ad hoc functions used by LIS namely "nest" and "gmls".

Given a list of unique numbers, the LIS function outputs all LIS from list i.e. the longest increasing subsequences having the maximum length among all results. To implement, type "from L_I_S import LIS" then try "LIS([2,5,1,3,4])". Note that the external module list_operations is required "from list_operations import unnest".
