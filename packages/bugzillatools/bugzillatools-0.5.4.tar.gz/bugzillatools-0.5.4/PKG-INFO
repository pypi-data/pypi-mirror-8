Description: bugzillatools consists of the ``bugzilla`` CLI program and a Python
        library for interacting with the Bugzilla_ bug tracking system, and
        plugins for version control systems that enable interaction with
        Bugzilla installations.
        
        The only dependency is Python_ 2.7 and bugzillatools works with
        Bugzilla_ 4.0 or later where the XML-RPC feature is enabled.

        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
          # via pip
          pip install bugzillatools         # as superuser
            -or-
          pip install bugzillatools --user  # user site-packages installation
        
          # from source
          python setup.py install           # as superuser
            -or-
          python setup.py install --user    # user site-packages installation
        
        The ``bin/`` directory in your user base directory will need to appear
        on the ``PATH`` if installing to user site-packages.  This directory is
        system dependent; see :pep:`370`.
        
        If installing to user site-packages, some manual moving or symlinking
        of files will be required for the Bazaar plugin to be detected by
        Bazaar.  :pep:`402` speaks to this shortcoming.
        
        
        Components
        ==========
        
        ``bugzilla`` program
        --------------------
        
        Command-line application for interacting with Bugzilla servers.
        The following subcommands are available:
        
        :assign:              Assign bugs to the given user.
        :block:               Show or update block list of given bugs.
        :cc:                  Show or update CC List.
        :comment:             List comments or file a comment on the given bugs.
        :config:              Show or update configuration.
        :depend:              Show or update dependencies of given bugs.
        :desc:                Show the description of the given bug(s).
        :dump:                Print internal representation of bug data.
        :edit:                Edit the given bugs.
        :fields:              List valid values for bug fields.
        :help:                Show help.
        :history:             Show the history of the given bugs.
        :info:                Show detailed information about the given bugs.
        :list:                Show a one-line summary of the given bugs.
        :new:                 File a new bug.
        :priority:            Set the priority on the given bugs.
        :products:            List the products of a Bugzilla instance.
        :search:              Search for bugs matching given criteria.
        :status:              Set the status of the given bugs.
        :time:                Show or adjust times and estimates for the given bugs.
        
        
        ``bzlib``
        ---------
        
        Library providing access to Bugzilla instances through the XML-RPC
        interface.  Supports bug creation, bug information and comment
        retrieval, updating bug fields and appending comments to bugs.
        
        
        Bazaar_ plugin
        --------------
        
        This plugin, when enabled for Bugzilla bugtrackers, marks bugs fixed on
        those trackers when ``bzr commit`` is invoked with the ``--fixes`` argument.
        It also adds a comment to the bug that includes the branch location, the
        commit message, the list of changed files and other details about the commit.
        
        The Bazaar_ plugin requires Bazaar 2.0 or later.
        
        .. _Bazaar: http://bazaar.canonical.com/
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        ``.bugzillarc``
        ---------------
        
        The ``bugzilla`` program looks for its configuration in
        ``~/.bugzillarc``, which uses ini-style configuration.
        
        ``core``
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        ``server``
          Name of the default server
        
        ``alias``
        ^^^^^^^^^
        
        Option names are aliases; their values are the replacement.
        
        ``server.<name>``
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Define a server.  bugzillatools supports multiple servers; the
        ``--server=<name>`` argument can be used to select a server.
        
        ``url``
          Base URL of the Bugzilla server (mandatory)
        ``user``
          Bugzilla username (optional)
        ``password``
          Bugzilla password (optional)
        ``assign_status``
          When the ``assign`` command is used, if the current status of a bug
          is in the first list, the status will be updated to the second item.
          The format is: ``<oldstatus>[,<oldstatus>]* <newstatus>``.  An
          appropriate value for the default Bugzilla workflow might be:
          ``"UNCONFIRMED,CONFIRMED IN_PROGRESS"``.
        ``default_product``
          If provided and if the provided string corresponds to the name of a
          product on this server, use that product as the default.  The user
          will still be prompted to confirm.
        
        
        Example ``.bugzillarc``
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
          [core]
          server = example
        
          [server.example]
          url = http://bugzilla.example.com
          user = user@example.com
          password = sekrit
        
          [alias]
          fix = status --status RESOLVED --resolution FIXED
          wfm = status --status RESOLVED --resolution WORKSFORME
          confirm = status --status CONFIRMED
        
        
        Bazaar plugin
        -------------
        
        To enable the Bazaar bugzillatools plugin, include following
        configuration directives in either ``~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf`` (global
        configuration) or ``.bzr/branch/branch.conf`` (within a branch)::
        
          bugzilla_<server>_bugzillatools_enable = True
          bugzilla_<server>_url = <bugzilla url>
          bugzilla_<server>_status = RESOLVED
          bugzilla_<server>_resolution = FIXED
        
        Such a configuration assumes that a section ``[server.<server>]``
        has been defined in your ``.bugzillarc``.
        
        You can now set the status of bugs (using the status and resolution
        defined in the Bazaar config) directly::
        
          bzr commit -m 'fix bug 123' --fixes <server>:123

        -------------------------
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - ``new`` command: fix assigned_to user matching.
        
        
        v0.5 :: Tue Jan 3 2012
        ----------------------
        
        New features:
        
        - ``search`` command: search for bugs matching given criteria.
        - ``history`` command: display bug history.
        - ``new`` command: new config ``server.<name>.default_product``, if set
          and if corresponding to a product on the server, specifies the default
          product.
        - ``new`` command: perform user matching when specifying the assignee or
          cc list during bug creation.
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - ``time`` command: calculate the hours worked on a bug.
        
        
        v0.4 :: Wed Nov 30 2011
        -----------------------
        
        New features:
        
        - ``time`` command: show or adjust times and estimates for given bug.
          At time of writing, limitations in Bugzilla's RPC API prevent the
          display of cumulative time for a bug.
        - ``desc`` command: show the description of the given bugs.
        - ``dump`` command: print internal representation of bug(s).
        - ``comment`` learned the ``--omit-empty`` and ``--include-empty``
          arguments; exclude or include empty comments (e.g. additional time
          worked, but no specific comment) from the output.  The default is to
          omit empty comments.
        - The ``assign`` command can now be configured (on a per-server basis)
          to change the status of a bug, using the ``assign_status`` option.
          See README for details.
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Bugzilla URLs are now more rigourously sanity checked.
        
        Other changes:
        
        - Configuration file syntax changed to ini-like (i.e., parsable by
          ``ConfigParser``).  JSON configuration is no longer supported.
        
        
        v0.3 :: Sun Aug 7 2011
        ----------------------
        
        New features:
        
        - Added the Bazaar plugin.
        - ``new`` command: file a new bug, prompting user for bug data.
        - ``status`` learned the ``--dupe-of`` argument; this is all that's needed
          to mark a bug as a duplicate of another (Bugzilla with automatically set
          the status and resolution fields to appropriate values).
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - ``status`` only prompts for resolution if new status is closed and
          current status is open (``--resolution`` may still be specified,
          however.)
        - The unused ``--choose-status`` and ``--choose-resolution`` arguments
          were removed from ``status``.
        - Fix the index-field width when displaying choose-from lists (was too
          wide when the number of items displayed was a power of 10)
        - Convert ``EOFError`` (``^D``) into ``bzlib.ui.RejectWarning`` when
          prompting user for input.
        - Don't bother prompting the user to choose an item from a list that
          contains only one item.
        
        
        v0.2.1 :: Tue Jul 12 2011
        -------------------------
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Support Unicode data in all commands.
        - Do not show 'aliases' heading in ``--help`` output if none defined.
        - Add global arguments to subcommand ``--help`` output.
        
        
        v0.2 :: Sat Jul 2 2011
        ----------------------
        
        New features:
        
        - ``comment`` now lists bug comments when no comment is given.
          ``--forward``, ``--reverse`` and ``--limit=N`` can be used to control
          output.
        - ``depend`` and ``block`` commands: show or update bug dependency
          relationships.
        - ``cc`` command: Show or update CC List.
        - ``fields`` command: List valid values for bug fields.
        - ``help`` command: Show help for a command, or the top-level help if
          no argument is given.
        - ``--version`` prints bugzillatools version.
        - Invoke EDITOR for comment input when comment required but not
          explicitly provided
        - User matching:  For commands that require usernames, instead of
          providing full username, if a provided fragment matches a single user
          that user will be used.
        - Command aliases: users can define their own aliases for commands and
          command arguments.
        - Replace ``close``, ``fix``, ``reopen`` and ``resolve`` commands with the
          single ``status`` command; commands to suit a particular workflow can be
          defined as aliases of ``status``, with appropriate arguments.
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Improved server misconfiguration or missing configuration handling.
        - List commands in alphabetical order.
        
        Other changes:
        
        - The default user configuration file changed to ``~/.bugzillarc``
          (formerly ~/.bugrc).
        
        
        v0.1.2 :: Fri Jun 17 2011

        New features:
        
        - ``products`` command: list products of a Bugzilla.
        - Describe subcommands in ``--help`` output.
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Handle server lookup failure when no servers are defined.
        
        
        v0.1 :: Sun Jun 12 2011
        -----------------------
        
        New features:
