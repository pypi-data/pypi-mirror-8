New features:

- ``search`` command: search for bugs matching given criteria.
- ``history`` command: display bug history.
- ``new`` command: new config ``server.<name>.default_product``, if set
  and if corresponding to a product on the server, specifies the default
  product.
- ``new`` command: perform user matching when specifying the assignee or
  cc list during bug creation.

Bug fixes:

- ``time`` command: calculate the hours worked on a bug.


v0.4 :: Wed Nov 30 2011
-----------------------

New features:

- ``time`` command: show or adjust times and estimates for given bug.
  At time of writing, limitations in Bugzilla's RPC API prevent the
  display of cumulative time for a bug.
- ``desc`` command: show the description of the given bugs.
- ``dump`` command: print internal representation of bug(s).
- ``comment`` learned the ``--omit-empty`` and ``--include-empty``
  arguments; exclude or include empty comments (e.g. additional time
  worked, but no specific comment) from the output.  The default is to
  omit empty comments.
- The ``assign`` command can now be configured (on a per-server basis)
  to change the status of a bug, using the ``assign_status`` option.
  See README for details.

Bug fixes:

- Bugzilla URLs are now more rigourously sanity checked.

Other changes:

- Configuration file syntax changed to ini-like (i.e., parsable by
  ``ConfigParser``).  JSON configuration is no longer supported.


v0.3 :: Sun Aug 7 2011
----------------------

New features:

- Added the Bazaar plugin.
- ``new`` command: file a new bug, prompting user for bug data.
- ``status`` learned the ``--dupe-of`` argument; this is all that's needed
  to mark a bug as a duplicate of another (Bugzilla with automatically set
  the status and resolution fields to appropriate values).

Bug fixes:

- ``status`` only prompts for resolution if new status is closed and
  current status is open (``--resolution`` may still be specified,
  however.)
- The unused ``--choose-status`` and ``--choose-resolution`` arguments
  were removed from ``status``.
- Fix the index-field width when displaying choose-from lists (was too
  wide when the number of items displayed was a power of 10)
- Convert ``EOFError`` (``^D``) into ``bzlib.ui.RejectWarning`` when
  prompting user for input.
- Don't bother prompting the user to choose an item from a list that
  contains only one item.


v0.2.1 :: Tue Jul 12 2011
-------------------------

Bug fixes:

- Support Unicode data in all commands.
- Do not show 'aliases' heading in ``--help`` output if none defined.
- Add global arguments to subcommand ``--help`` output.


v0.2 :: Sat Jul 2 2011
----------------------

New features:

- ``comment`` now lists bug comments when no comment is given.
  ``--forward``, ``--reverse`` and ``--limit=N`` can be used to control
  output.
- ``depend`` and ``block`` commands: show or update bug dependency
  relationships.
- ``cc`` command: Show or update CC List.
- ``fields`` command: List valid values for bug fields.
- ``help`` command: Show help for a command, or the top-level help if
  no argument is given.
- ``--version`` prints bugzillatools version.
- Invoke EDITOR for comment input when comment required but not
  explicitly provided
- User matching:  For commands that require usernames, instead of
  providing full username, if a provided fragment matches a single user
  that user will be used.
- Command aliases: users can define their own aliases for commands and
  command arguments.
- Replace ``close``, ``fix``, ``reopen`` and ``resolve`` commands with the
  single ``status`` command; commands to suit a particular workflow can be
  defined as aliases of ``status``, with appropriate arguments.

Bug fixes:

- Improved server misconfiguration or missing configuration handling.
- List commands in alphabetical order.

Other changes:

- The default user configuration file changed to ``~/.bugzillarc``
  (formerly ~/.bugrc).
