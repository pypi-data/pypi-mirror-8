"""
A plugin to allow POSTing obsels to a StoredTrace with a GET.

This is of course a Bad Thingâ„¢, as GET requests should be safe and idempotent.
However, this is required in some contexts
where issuing a POST request is not possible.

The protocol is to GET (trace_uri)?ctype=(content-type)&post=(payload)
