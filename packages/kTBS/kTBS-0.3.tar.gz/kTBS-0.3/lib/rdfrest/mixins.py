    I add reserved namespaces to the mixed-in class.

    A *reserved namespace* is a set of URIs (defined by a common prefix) which
    can not be freely used in the description of the resource, as they have a
    specific meaning for the application.

    Reserved namespaces are listed in the `RDF_RESERVED_NS` class variable (in
    addition to those inherited from superclasses).

    The reserved namespace applies to URIs used as predicates and types.
    The default rule is that they can not be added at creation time (in a graph
    passed to :meth:`~.interface.IResource.post_graph`) nor at
    :meth:`~.interface.IResource.edit` time. They can only be inserted and
    modified by the service itself (i.e. in
    :meth:`~.local.ILocalResource.create` or in a *trusted*
    :meth:`~.local.ILocalResource.edit` contexts).

    It is however possible to provide exceptions for a class, *i.e.* URIs
    inside a reserved namespace which can freely set: at creation time only, or
    at edit time (including creation); as incoming property, outgoing property
    or type. All those exceptions are listed in the corresponding class 
    attributes from the list below (in addition to those inherited from
    superclasses).

    * `RDF_CREATABLE_IN`
    * `RDF_CREATABLE_OUT`
    * `RDF_CREATABLE_TYPES`
    * `RDF_EDITABLE_IN`
    * `RDF_EDITABLE_OUT`
    * `RDF_EDITABLE_TYPES`

    Note that the `RDF_MAIN_TYPE` is always implictly added to
    `RDF_CREATABLE_TYPES` so it is not necessary to specify it there.

# a method ack_watch_X(uri, old_value, new_value)  whete X is 'type', 'in' or
