Description: ====================================
        The ``commondata`` namespace package
        ====================================
        
        Note: we are discussing whether this package is meaningful.  See

        This package is the heart of "common data", a sustainable way of
        maintaining and sharing structured common knowledge.  The Python
        package itself contains just some utilities and defines the
        ``commondata`` namespace. It is the base for packages like
        
        - `commondata.be <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata-be>`_ : 
          Common knowledge about Belgium
        - `commondata.ee <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata-ee>`_: 
          Common knowledge about Estonia
        
        
        Maintained in Python
        --------------------
        
        The Python programming language brings together two qualities 
        
        - a syntax which makes it easy (or at least possible) to be used by
          non-programmers
        - a powerful programming language working behind the scenes
        
        
        
        
        Freely available under the GPL
        ------------------------------
        
        Free software should not depend on non-free material.
        
        Designed to be imported
        -----------------------
        
        The library does **not** provide much querying functionality.  Just
        the basic minimum, used to write test cases.  This is a design
        choice. This data is meant to be imported into existing systems which
        offer their own querying facilities.
