Description: # ifttt (If That Then This)
        `ifttt` is a simple package for connecting [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) 
        channels with your service via and email inbox.
        
        ## what?
        
        [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) provides an interface to an amazing number of services, but since they
        lack their own API and have a closed submission process, it's difficult to integrate it into
        your applications.  
        
        By creating a set of transformations for routing IFTTT channels to email,
        we can pass structured data to custom email-listener functions â€“ `ifthat`
        which can be routed to an arbitrary `thenthis` function that a user defines.
        
        ## installation / dependencies 
        
        ```
        pip install ifttt
        ```
        
        Our implementation is written and native python 2.7 and has no dependencies.
        
        ## examples
        
        ###  If That Then Say Tweet ... 
        
        ```python 
        from ifttt import ifthat
        
        @ifthat('twitter', pattern = "{{UserName}}|||||{{LinkToTweet}}|||||{{Text}}|||||")
        def twitter(msg):
        	import os 
        	os.system('tweet from {text}'.format(**msg['body']))
        
        for msg in twitter():
        	print msg
        ```
        
        ### If This Then Say YO
        
        ```python
        from ifttt import ifthat
        
        @ifthat('yo', pattern="{{ReceivedAt}}|||||{{From}}|||||")
        def then_yo(msg):
        	import os
        	os.system('say yo from {from} &'.format(**msg['body']))
        	return msg 
        	
        for msg in yo():
        	print msg
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        export these environmental variables:
        
        ```bash
        export IFTTT_USERNAME='username@domain.com'
        export IFTTT_PASSWORD='password'
        export IFTTT_IMAP_SERVER='mail.domain.com'
        export IFTTT_IMAP_PORT=993
        ```
