Description: # ifttt
        helpers for connecting [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) with any other service via `email`
        
        ## what?
        
        [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) provides an interface to an amazing number of services, but since they
        lack their own API and have a closed submission process, it's difficult to integrate it into
        your applications.  
        
        By creating a set of transformations for routing IFTTT channels to email,
        we can pass structured data to custom callback functions – `ifthis` – or listen to other services and send emails which can be processed by IFTTT - `thenthat`.
        
        ## installation / dependencies 
        
        ```
        pip install ifttt
        ```
        
        Our implementation is written and native python 2.7 and has no dependencies.
        
        ## examples
        
        ###  If This ... 
        
        ```python 
        from ifttt import ifthis
        
        pattern = pattern = { 
        	"user_name": "{{UserName}}", 
        	"published": "{{CreatedAt}}", 
        	"short_url": "{{LinkToTweet}}",
        	"text": "{{Text}}"
        }
        
        @ifthis('twitter', pattern=pattern)
        def twitter(msg):
        	import os
        	print msg
        	os.system('say {text}'.format(**msg['body']))
        
        
        # when we run this script it will listen indefinitely for new messages
        # on this routing key
        if __name__=="__main__":
        	twitter()
        
        ```
        
        ### Channels  (In Progress!, Please Contributes)
        ```python
        from ifttt import channels
        from pprint import pprint
        
        pprint(channels) ## a simple dictionary
        ```
        
        ### configuration
        
        export these environmental variables:
        
        ```bash
        export IFTTT_USERNAME='username@domain.com'
        export IFTTT_PASSWORD='password'
        export IFTTT_IMAP_SERVER='mail.domain.com'
        export IFTTT_IMAP_PORT=993
        export IFTTT_SMTP_SERVER='mail.domain.com'
        export IFTTT_SMTP_PORT=587
        ```
        
        ## TODO
        - [ ] Delete Messages 
        - [ ] Create [comprehensive libraries of channels](ifttt/lib.py)
