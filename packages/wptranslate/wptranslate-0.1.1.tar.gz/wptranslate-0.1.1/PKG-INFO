        ``wptranslate`` is a command-line translator tool based on Wikipedia.
        
        It should be used for concepts and vague topics where a typical translator tool
        wouldn’t give an accurate translation, but not for other things. For example,
        you won’t be able to translate a whole sentence with it.
