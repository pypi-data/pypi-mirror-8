Description: 
        I (Jim Lim) am releasing this to pypi under quixey for personal convenience.
        
        This module provides low-level protocol support for Apache Kafka as well as
        high-level consumer and producer classes. Request batching is supported by the
        protocol as well as broker-aware request routing. Gzip and Snappy compression
        is also supported for message sets.
