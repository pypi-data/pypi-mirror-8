class MtrxData(access2thematrix.MtrxData):
    '''
        The methods to open result files and to select one out of the four
        traces (forward/up, backward/up, forward/down and backward/down).

    def open(self, result_data_file):
        '''
        Opens a MATRIX Control System result file.

        In attribute scan the images are stored. In attribute param the
        metadata and parameters of the experiment are stored. See source code.

        Parameters
        ----------
        result_data_file : str
            The pathname of the MATRIX Control System result file.

        Returns
        -------
        traces : dict
            Dictionary of enumerated tracenames for the trace parameter in
            the instancemethod select_image.
        message : str
            Error or succes message of the opening of the file.

        The selected image is returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        trace : str, optional
            Use the traces dictionary, a return from the open method, to set
            this parameter.

        Returns
        -------
        im : access2theMatrix_image_structure
            Returns a Im class (image structure) containing the selected
            image and metadata.
        message : str
            Error or succes message of the image selection.
