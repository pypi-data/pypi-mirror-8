    """A reference to the wall of a room.

    A wall has an index, a direction, a span and a position.
      * The index is its position in the list of walls. This corresponds to its
        symbolic name.
      * The direction is a direction vector for the wall; up and right are
        positive directions. The direction is the movement vector in the maze
        room matrix and not necessarily an actual physical direction.
      * The span is the physical start and end angle of the wall.
      * The position is the coordinates of the room to which the wall belongs in
        the maze room matrix.

    Furthermore, walls know their back and opposite.
      * The back is the same wall in the room on the other side of a wall. A
        wall will compare equally with its back.
      * The opposite is the wall opposing a wall in the same room. Depending on
        the layout of a room, there may be no opposite wall. Triangular mazes do
        not have opposite walls.

    Walls have factory methods.
      * from_direction will create a wall when the room and the direction is
        known. The direction must be the direction vector of the room.
      * from_room_pos will create all walls for a room.
