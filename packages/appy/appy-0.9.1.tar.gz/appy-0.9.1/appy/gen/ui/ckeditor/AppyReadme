This is ckeditor 4.4.4 (standard package), integrated into Appy on 2014/09/11.

Readme files (*.md), build-config.js, sub-folders "samples" and "adapters"
 have been deleted.
Files config.js, contents.css and styles.js have been modified.
Files named _translationstatus.txt have been removed (for Zope compatibility)
 because of their leading "_".

ckeditor/plugins/wsc/dialogs/tmpFrameset.html has been modified because Zope
 complains that, in this file, frame tags are defined with an ending tag. So I've
 replaced every <frame..></frame> occurrence by <frame.../>.
