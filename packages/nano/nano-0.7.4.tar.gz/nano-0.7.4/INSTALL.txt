Thanks for downloading django-nano.

Install via 
- unpacking and running 'python setup.py install'
- pip install django-nano
- easy_install django-nano

These tools and applications require Python 2.6 or later, and Django
1.4 or later. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and
Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
