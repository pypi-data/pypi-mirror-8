Add multipath-tools to built images
===================================

This element adds multipath-tools to the image. These tools manage the kernel
device mapper based multipath support.

See [multipath-tools](http://christophe.varoqui.free.fr/) for more information.

This element installs multipath with a default configuration that disables
multipath for all block devices. The user can then customise the config to suit
their environment.
