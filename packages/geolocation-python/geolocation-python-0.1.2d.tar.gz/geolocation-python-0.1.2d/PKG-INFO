        address = "New York City Wall Street 12"
        
        google_maps = GoogleMaps(api_key='your_google_maps_key') 
        
        location = google_maps.search(location=address) # sends search to Google Maps.
        
        print(location.all()) # returns all locations.
        
        my_location = location.first() # returns only first location.
        
        print(my_location.city)
        print(my_location.route)
        print(my_location.street_number)
        print(my_location.postal_code)
        
        for administrative_area in my_location.administrative_area:
            print("{}: {}".format(administrative_area.area_type, administrative_area.name))
        
        print(my_location.country)
        print(my_location.country_shortcut)
        
        print(my_location.formatted_address)
        
        print(my_location.lat)
        print(my_location.lng)
        
        # reverse geocode
        
        lat = 40.7060008
        lng = -74.0088189
        
        my_location = google_maps.search(lat=lat, lng=lng).first()
