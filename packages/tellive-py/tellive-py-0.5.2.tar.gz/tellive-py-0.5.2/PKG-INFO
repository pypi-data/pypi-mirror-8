        tellive-py is a Python wrapper for `Telldus Live <http://live.telldus.com/>`_,
        "a user friendly service for automating your TellStick connected gear using the
        Internet".

        Please report any problem as a `GitHub issue report
        <https://github.com/erijo/tellive-py/issues/new>`_.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Includes the script `tellive_core_connector
          <https://github.com/erijo/tellive-py/blob/master/bin/tellive_core_connector>`_
          for connecting a e.g. a Tellstick Duo to Telldus Live without needing Telldus
          Center. Supports both devices and sensors.
        * Open source (`GPLv3+
          <https://github.com/erijo/tellive-py/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_).
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Python 3.2+
        * `tellcore-py <https://github.com/erijo/tellcore-py>`_
        * On Mac OS X, `appnope <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/appnope>`_ is
          recommended.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install tellive-py
        
        Example
        -------
        
        To run the included program for connecting a TellStick to Telldus Live:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ tellive_core_connector ~/.config/tellive.conf
        
        The first time you run the program (with a particular config file), it will
        exit and ask you to visit a given URL to give the program access to your
        account.
        
        When you have done so, you can then edit the config file
        (``~/.config/tellive.conf`` in this example) and add a name to the sensors that
        you wish to send to Telldus Live. You can also disable devices that you don't
        want to be controllable via Telldus Live (see ``tellive_core_connector --help``
        for more info). Then start the program again as above.
        
        The API can also be used by your own program. This how you would connect to
        Telldus Live and register the client (with PUBLIC_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY from
        `here <http://api.telldus.com/keys/index>`_):
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            client = TellstickLiveClient(PUBLIC_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY)
            (server, port) = client.connect_to_first_available_server()
            client.register(version="0.1")

        * Support marking devices as disabled to not show up in Telldus Live.
        
        
        0.2.0 (2014-02-02)
        ------------------

          need to use private tokens.
        * Log using the standard logging module.
        * Reconnect if connection is lost for some reason.
        * Fixed problem with Python 3.2.
        * Added support for reload request from server.
        * Only report sensors that are named in the config file.
