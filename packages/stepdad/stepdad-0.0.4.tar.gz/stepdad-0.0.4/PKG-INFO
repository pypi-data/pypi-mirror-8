Description: ``stepdad``'s purpose is to be able to round up and bring order to those many standalone python modules that maybe you
        wrote or found on the web at some point and have kept a copy (or copies) ever sense.
        
        Given just a single python file (module), ``stepdad`` will create an appropriate setup.py and other files if necessary.
        All metadata is carefully tracked so that when it comes time to upgrade you just ...upgrade like you would any other
        python module or package.
