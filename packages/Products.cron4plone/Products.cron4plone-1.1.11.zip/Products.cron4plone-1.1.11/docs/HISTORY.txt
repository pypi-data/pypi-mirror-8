1.1.9 (2011-05-19)
------------------

- Add MANIFEST.in to include docs in release. [WouterVH]

  values to integers at first use. [davidjb]

1.1.6 (2010-10-19)
------------------

- No longer support for the extened cron syntax with the /N and N-M formats

  syntax. That old code has been moved to a enumeration-support branch.
