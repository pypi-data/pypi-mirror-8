        pyapns is an APNS provider that you install on your server and access through XML-RPC.
        To install you will need Python, Twisted_ and pyOpenSSL_. It's also recommended to 
        install `python-epoll`_ for best performance (if epoll is not available, like on 
        Mac OS X, you may want to use another library, like `py-kqueue`_. If you like 
        easy_install try (it should take care of the dependancies for you)::
        
            $ sudo pip install pyapns
        
        pyapns is a service that runs persistently on your machine. To start it::
        
            $ twistd -r epoll web --class=pyapns.server.APNSServer --port=7077
        
        To get started right away, use the included client::
        
            $ python
            >>> from pyapns import configure, provision, notify
            >>> configure({'HOST': 'http://localhost:7077/'})
            >>> provision('myapp', open('cert.pem').read(), 'sandbox')
            >>> notify('myapp', 'hexlified_token_str', {'aps':{'alert': 'Hello!'}})
