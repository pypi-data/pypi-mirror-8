version 0.4.0 - 2012-02-14
==========================

New:

  * Client interface methods have more explicit arguments and now take an 
    error callback.

    The `provision` `notify` and `feedback` methods in v0.3.2 would
    implicitly assume they should perform asynchronously if the `callback`
    argument was supplied. They would spin off a thread, later calling
    the callback.

    Now those methods take an `async` parameter, when True, will spin off
    the XML-RPC request in another thread, calling `callback(result)` when
    complete or `errback(exception)` if an error occurred.

  * Clients will now automatically try to re-provision themselves if `INITIAL`
    was provided during configuration. This helps, in case the server goes
    down, to be able to retry provisioning at least once.

Fixed bugs:

  * Fixed #21 - logging of full contents of file PEM file when providing the 
    whole thing in `provision()`

  * Fixed #25 - provide a wrapper for api functions which will automaticaly 
    try to reprovision should it encounter a `UknownAppID`.

Other:

  * Removed some of the redundant documentation from the setup.py file. 
    Eventually I want to move to sphynx docs. That software didn't really 
    exist in the same capacity in 2010 as it does now.
