Concepts Changelog
==================


Version 0.7.9
-------------

Added move_object and move_property to definitions.

The take-method of definitions now supports skipping all objects or properties
when called with empty iterables (default None means include all).

Simplified __getitem__ examples.


Version 0.7.8
-------------

Fixed a possible encoding issue with tofile().

Visualize more examples.

Added tests for formats dump/load file roundtrips.


Version 0.7.7
-------------

Changed context __eq__ test with non-contexts from TypeError to NotImplemented.

Fixed non-working augmented assignment operators on definitions.
Simplified definition implementation.


Version 0.7.6
-------------

Added context definition objects, allowing interactive building, modification,
and combination of context creation arguments.

Added include_unary option to logical connectives calculation.


Version 0.7.5
-------------

Made derivation code more explicit. Subset test replaced by inlined
implementation using only bitwise_and.


Version 0.7.4
-------------

Changed context._lattice to a generator.

Fixed failure to handle contexts with single object/property.


Version 0.7.3
-------------

Improved context/lattice division of labour: context now computes all concepts
with their covering relation, while lattice only builds/decorates the object-
based representation.

Improved context and bitset interface used by lattice (reduce_and, reduce_or).
Added doubleprime method to extents and intents.
Added raw option to intension, extension, and neighbors method of context.

Added EXAMPLE context for repl experiments.


Version 0.7.2
-------------

Context relation now omits orthogonal pairs in __str__().


Version 0.7.1
-------------

Fixed CSV export with Python 3.3+.


Version 0.7
-----------

Added Python 3.3+ support.

Set default UTF-8 encoding in context tofile().


Version 0.6.2
-------------

Switch setup.py dependencies to version ranges.


Version 0.6.1
-------------

Added make_context.

Improved documentation.


Version 0.6
-----------

Added orthogonal_to.

Changed attributes to return a generator instead of a list.

Improved doctests.


Version 0.5
-----------

Upset and downset of concept object now are iterable-returning methods instead
of properties (backwards incompatible). 

Changed concept object minimal generating properties to be computed on request
instead of being precomputed during lattice build; changed minimal and
attributes from properties to methods (backwards incompatible). 

Improved unicode support.

Changed pickling of lattice and concepts.

Changed ordering of downset and lower_neighbors to longlex.


Version 0.4
-----------

Add context file csv format.

Added newline normalization to context file loading.

Update bitset dependency to 0.5 (better neighbors).

Backwards incompatible: removed underscore from (from|to)_(string|file) method
names.


Version 0.3
-----------

Update graphviz interface dependency to 0.2 (UTF-8 support) with changed api.


Version 0.2.3
-------------

Support empty iterables in Lattice join and meet.


Version 0.2.2
-------------

Simplified graphviz quoting.


Version 0.2.1
-------------

Improved visualization.


Version 0.2
-----------

Added loading and dumping of contexts and include some example cxt files.

Make context objects pickleable.

Context and lattice methods no more implicitly split string arguments.


Version 0.1.4
-------------

Switch to standalone graphviz interface implementation.

-------------

Refine packaging info.


Version 0.1.2
-------------

Account for bitsets internal api change.

Improve documentation.


Version 0.1.1
-------------

Switch to standalone bitsets implementation.


Version 0.1
-----------

First public release.
