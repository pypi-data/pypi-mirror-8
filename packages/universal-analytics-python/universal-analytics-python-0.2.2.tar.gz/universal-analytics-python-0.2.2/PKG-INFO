Description: Universal Analytics for Python
        ==============================
        An interface for the Universal Analytics Measurement Protocol, modeled 
        (loosely) after Google's ``analytics.js``.
        
        This project is reasonably feature-complete for most use-cases,
        covering all relevant features of the Measurement Protocol, however we
        still consider it *beta*. Please feel free to file issues for feature
        requests.
