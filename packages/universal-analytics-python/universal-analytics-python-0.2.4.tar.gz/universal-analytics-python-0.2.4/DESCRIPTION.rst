Universal Analytics for Python
==============================
An interface for the Universal Analytics Measurement Protocol, modeled 
(loosely) after Google's ``analytics.js``.

This project is reasonably feature-complete for most use-cases,
covering all relevant features of the Measurement Protocol, however we
still consider it *beta*. Please feel free to file issues for feature
requests.
