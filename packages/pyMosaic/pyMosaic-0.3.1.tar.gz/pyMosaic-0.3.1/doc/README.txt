The Mosaic documentation uses the Sphinx documentation system
(http://sphinx-doc.org/). To build the documentation, run

   make html

The generated documentation will be in build/html. Other output
formats are available but may require additional tools for
building. See the Sphinx documentation for the details.

Since the documentation includes the Python API reference, you should
install the Mosaic Python library before building the documentation.
