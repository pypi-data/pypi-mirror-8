Description: Baserip
        =======
        
        Baserip is a tool for copying a single video title from a DVD whilst 
        transcoding it. The purpose of this is to make the video available 
        to devices you may have which do not have a DVD player.
        
        Baserip is designed to work with a clean DVD source like the ones you get 
        on bought DVD disks.
        Baserip was created because Acidrip is no longer being maintained 
        and I found myself needing a DVD ripper, if you're interested a little more 
        please see :ref:`motivation`. 
        
        The design of Baserip was heavily influenced by Acidrip but has now 
        significantly changed.
        Baserip is, in fact, a simple front-end to avlib/avconv which is 
        itself a front-end to some video encoding and decoding libraries. Everything 
        that Baserip does can be achieved from the command line, Baserip just 
        simplifies the process.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Unpack the tarball and go into the top level directory. As root 
        type::
        
            python3 setup.py install
        
        The installation directory is usually:
        /usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-utils
        
        Here you will find Baserip. Within Baserip you will find a "share" 
        directory. In this there is a .desktop file and an icon. You can use 
        these to manually add an entry to your desktop menu system.
        
        
        Requirements
