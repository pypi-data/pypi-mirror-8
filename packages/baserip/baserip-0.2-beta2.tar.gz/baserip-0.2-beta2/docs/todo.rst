**Any offers of help will be gratefully received**

Things that *need* to be done
-----------------------------

* Testing, testing, testing.
  Haven't got enough facilities to thoroughly test Baserip. I need a 
  large user base. Not likely to happen, ho hum.

* Document the code.

* Improve setup code to integrate with desktops.

* Read lsdvd as xml not python code (security!).


Things that *should* be done
----------------------------

* Implement unit tests.

* Save settings and recall them when a DVD is re-inserted.

* Pause a job (is this even possible?).

* Set up web-site (sourceforge?) with bug tracking - just discovered 
  there's already a Baserip - bugger!

* Run code through PyLint, take a deep breath and read results.

* Auto-detect of telecine and use pullup and softskip filters (looks difficult
  to do it reliably).

Things that *could* be done
---------------------------

* Allow selection of backend - avconv, ffmpeg or gstreamer.

* Set up job queues.

* Export of jobs to shell script?

* Make Baserip front-end agnostic (Qt, Gtk and curses).

* Port to other systems (windows, mac).
