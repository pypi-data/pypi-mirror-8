Description: 
                Agalma is an automated tool that constructs matrices for
                phylogenomic analyses, allowing complex phylogenomic analyses to be
                implemented and described unambiguously as a series of high-level
                commands.  The user provides raw Illumina transcriptome data, and
                Agalma produces annotated assemblies, aligned gene sequence matrices,
                a preliminary phylogeny, and detailed diagnostics that allow the
                investigator to make extensive assessments of intermediate analysis
                steps and the final results.  Sequences from other sources, such as
                externally assembled genomes and transcriptomes, can also be
                incorporated in the analyses. Agalma is built on the BioLite
                bioinformatics framework, which tracks provenance, profiles processor
                and memory use, records diagnostics, manages metadata, installs
                dependencies, logs version numbers and calls to external programs, and
                enables rich HTML reports for all stages of the analysis. Agalma
                includes a small test data set and a built-in test analysis of these
                data.
