Description: Wrapper arround freshdesk REST API
        ===================================
        
        **This work is not officialy supported by Freshdesk**
        
        This code is bare glue to consume Freshdesk REST API, plus some convenience
        methods.
        
        Note that it's partial (covering only Contacts and Customers resources), but
        should be very quick to extend.
