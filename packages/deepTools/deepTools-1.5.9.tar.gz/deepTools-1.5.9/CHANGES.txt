1.5.9: 
* Fixed problem with pseudocounts. The original implementation was scaling pseudocounts twice, which resulted in unexpected results for regions with zero reads.
* The tools bigWigCorrelate and bamPEFragmentSize where added to galaxy.
* Added parameter missingDataAsZero to bamCoverage. The default behaviour is unchanged.
* Improved error reporting of bamCorrelate when few bins are computed.
