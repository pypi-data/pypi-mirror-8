 NUM = ChIP treatment 
 DEN = Input

 calculate p-values assuming 
      NUM = signal-N + noise-N (where contribution 
                                   of signal-N & noise-N is unknown)

      DEN = signal-D + noise-D (where contribution of signal-D & noise-D is unknown)

      p-value = probability of null hypothesis = signal-N is the same as signal-D

          1. identify regions of NUM with highest values -> greatest contribution of signal-N (so least contribution of noise-N)
          2. if signal-N = signal-D, these should also correspond to regions of DEN with greatest contribution of signal-D
               (even if contribution of signal-D to DEN is still small compared to noise-D)
          3. calculate mean(NUM) at these regions = mean(noise-N) + mean(high signal-N) 
                                                  = mean(noise-N) + mean(signal-N) + mean(extra signal-N at these regions)
                                                  = mean(NUM) + mean(extra signal-N at these regions)
          4. calculate mean(DEN) at these regions = mean(noise-D) + mean(high signal-D) 
                                                  = mean(noise-D) + mean(signal-D) + mean(extra signal-D at these regions)
                                                  = mean(DEN) + mean(extra signal-D at these regions)
          5. estimate ratio of magnitudes of signal in NUM & DEN:
               since magnitude of extra signal at particular regions is proportional to magnitude of mean signal,
               signalRatio = mean(signal-N)/mean(signal-D)
                           = mean(extra signal-N at these regions)/mean(extra signal-D at these regions)
          6. now, for every genomic interval, calculate lambda = expected DEN signal, from NUM signal based on null hypothesis:
               lambda = expected DEN signal = mean(DEN) + (NUM signal - mean(NUM))/signalRatio
          7. use calculated lambda to determine p-value that signal â‰¤ observed DEN signal

SYNOPSIS: compareSignal [options] DENOMINATORFILE.bed NUMERATORFILE.bed

OPTIONS:   -c = input files sorted by CHROM (requires less memory)
           -f = FRAGMENT size = 2x offset for shifting tag positions (default = 300)
                (set to 'pe' for paired-end data)
           -s = STEP size to write output (default =50)
           -w = WINDOW size to count tags (default = 200), or
           -r = REGION file of genomic intervals to count tags
           -m = MAXIMUM ratio of underlying NUM/DEN signal (default = 10)
use 'stdin' to read either file from STDIN

NOTE: retains duplicate BED values (=same chrom, chromStart values)
