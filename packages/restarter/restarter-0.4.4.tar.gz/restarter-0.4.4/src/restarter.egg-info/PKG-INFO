Description: restarter
        =========
        
        `restarter` is a little utility to restart services if referenced objects
        like executables or shared libraries have changed on disk. The goal is to ensure
        that all services run current versions of their software. This is important for
        example after security updates.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        `restarter` takes a pidfile as required argument. If the service is stale, that
        means there are replaced objects still held in memory, `restarter` executes the
        restart command passed via the `--restart` option::
        
           restarter --restart "/etc/init.d/atd restart" /var/run/atd.pid
        
        There is also the possibility to speficy a "hard restart" command that is
        executed if the regular restart command fails.
        
        See the output of `restarter --help` for a list of all supported options.
        
        
        Stopped Services
        ----------------
        
        Stopped services are gracefully ignored: `restarter` does nothing if the pidfile
        does not exist or the pid referenced therein is not running. This behaviour can
        be modified with the `--fail` option. Note that `restarter` always fails when
        the service was running but did not come up again after restart.
