Graphics in strategy.rst:

** Graphic: Lots of nodes/edges -> fewer nodes/edges
** Graphic: One process and edge -> Split into different times

As GT progresses, calculate current impact and current impact using worst case method (to see how close to convergence)

Be smart, and special case where actual impact << worst-case impact (otherwise premature cutoff)

Document the start and end parameters for worst-case method creation
