Description: Django Widgy Blog
        =================
        
        This is reusable blog app designed for use with django-widgy_. It can
        be utilized as a drop-in addition to a widgy project for creating a
        quick, run-of-the-mill blog or as an abstract guide to building your
        own custom app that takes advantage of all the wonderful features that
        widgy offers.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        (This guide assumes that your project is already using widgy. Please see
        this tutorial_ if this is not the case.)
        
        1.  Install the package
        
                $ pip install django-widgy-blog
        
        2.  Add ``widgy_blog`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        3.  Run ``python manage.py syncdb`` and ``python manage.py migrate`` in
            order to generate the relevant models in the database.
        
        4.  Configure the urls:
        
            a.  If you're using widgy's ``contrib.urlconf_include`` package, you can
                opt to use widgy_blog as a plugin. This allows admin users of the site
                to take advantage of plugin-specific features, such as editing the url
                route of the blog and customizing its addition to menus. See
                urlconf_include_ for more information.
        
            b.  Alternatively, you can include the widgy_blog urls within your urls.py
                file as you normally would. Just remember to add them before the
                included Mezzanine urls if your editing the root conf!
        
        5.  That's it. Log in to the admin center and start adding blog posts!

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.1.0 (release September 16, 2014)
        ----------------------------------
        
        - Add model attributes to AbstractBlogLayout and BlogAdmin
          that make them easier to subclass. Update AbstractBlogLayout
          published queryset function to use fewer queries [Scott Clark, #18]
        - **Backwards Incompatible:** Registered the ``BlogLayout`` model with widgy.
          If you weren't using this as your Blog layout, you will need to unregister
          it::
        
              import widgy
              from widgy_blog.models import BlogLayout
        
              widgy.unregister(BlogLayout)
        
          If you were already registering the ``BlogLayout`` yourself, you can just
          remove that code.
