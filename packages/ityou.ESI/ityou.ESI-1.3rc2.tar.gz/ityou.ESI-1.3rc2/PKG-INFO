        Installation
        ============
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        **Important**: This product needs further software. Before you install ESI, 
        you have to install the following packages:
        
        1) *Plone 4.3* Content management software, based on Zope (http://plone.org)
        
        2) *PostgreSQL* database server (http://postgresql.org/) and 
        
        3) *Redis* key value store (http://redis.io/).
        
        
        Furthermore, if you'd like to generate thumnails form websites, you should install
        *cutycapt* (http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/).
        
        In addition you may install some optinal software package to generate thumbnails
        from documents (i.e. *ImageMagick*, *unoconv*). 
        
        We will explain the installation on *Ubuntu LTS 12.4 Server*. The installation on other 
        Linux distributions is simular. Installation on Mac OS or Windows may differ, please 
        refer to the corresponding support.
        
        
        **1) Install PostgreSQL**::
            
            sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all
        
        
        **2) Install Redis**::
        
            sudo apt-get install redis hiredis
        
        
        **3) Install Plone 4.3**
        
        There are several ways to install Plone. The easyest way is to download Plone
        form http://plone.org/products/plone/, untar it and install it with::
        
            sudo ./install.sh --target=<where to put your instance> standalone
        
        This will install a standalone Plone instance. For futher information on how to
        install Plone, see http://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/index.html.
        
        
        Installing ITYOU ESI
        --------------------
        
        ESI is an Plone add on. You may install it with *buildout*. First, you have to 
        configure your **buildout.cfg** (in this example situated in /src/zope/esi/zinstance/):
        
        
        * Add ``ityou.ESI`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g. ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                ityou.ESI
        
               
        * Tell the *plone.recipe.zope2instance* recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                ityou.ESI
        
              
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
                
        
        Configuration of postgresql
        ---------------------------
        
        You need to create a *postgres* user and to grand the nessesary rights::
        
            sudo -u postgres psql
            
            create database ityou_esi;
        
            create user <YOUR DATABASE USER> with password '<DATABASE USERS PASSWORD>';
        
            grant all on database ityou_esi to ityou_esi_user;
        
        Start *postgresql* if not yet running::
        
            sudo service postgresql start
        
        Then you have to add in *buildout.cfg* in the section 'zope-conf-additional' the following
        lines so that Plone finds your postgres database::
        
            zope-conf-additional =
              
              ...
        
              <product-config ityou_esi>
                  # -- postgresql parameters 
                  psql_db         ityou_esi
                  psql_username   <DATABASE USER>
                  psql_password   <DATABASE USERS PASSWORD> 
                  psql_host       localhost
                  psql_port       5432
              </product-config>
        
              ...
        
        Re-run buildout and restart Plone
        
        
        Adding the zope clock server
        ----------------------------
        If you want the users to receive emails when a object is added/updated, you need 
        to install the zope clock server.
        
        Add the following lines in *buildout.cfg* in the section ''zope-conf-additional ::
        
            zope-conf-additional =
                ...
        
                <clock-server>
                    host <YOUR HOST>
                    method /esi/@@send-notification
                    period 60
                    user admin
                    password <ADMINISTRATION PASSWORD>
                </clock-server>
                ...
            
        for further information about how to configure the clock server, please visit
        http://docs.plone.org/develop/plone/misc/asyncronoustasks.html
        
        
        Start Redis
        -----------
        
        The Redis server should be running after installation or you have to start it
        manually:: 
        
            sudo service redis-server start
        
        
        That's it. Enjoy.
