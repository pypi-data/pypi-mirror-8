Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files 
in their native formats and transforms them into a tree. 
Configuration changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it 
back into native config files.

Augeas goals:

    * Manipulate configuration files safely, safer than the ad-hoc techniques 
      generally used with grep, sed, awk and similar mechanisms in 
      scripting languages
    * Provide a local configuration API for Linux
    * Make it easy to integrate new config files into the Augeas tree

Instructions on how to explore the current implementation can be found on 
http://augeas.net/

        all nodes with that label; the index can be a positive number N, which
        matches exactly the Nth node with that label (counting from 1), or the
        special expression 'last()' which matches the last node with the given
        label. All matches are done in fixed positions in the tree, and nothing
