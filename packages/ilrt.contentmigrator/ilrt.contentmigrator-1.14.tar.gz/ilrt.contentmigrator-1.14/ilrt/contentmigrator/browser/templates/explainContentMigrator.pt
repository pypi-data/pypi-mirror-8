<h3> <code>ContentMigrator</code> Tool </h3>

<p>
    This tool provides a means to export the content from an old plone 2.* site 
    to the plone 3 generic setup structure folder.<br />
    Use the containing ilrt.contentmigrator egg in plone 3 to do a full import of all the content.
</p>

<p>
The exporter is contained in a Product designed for use in old plone, ie before 3, 
(and possibly plain zope) sites.<br />
It exports the content into a plone3 style generic setup structure folder.<br />

Simply drop the ContentMigrator folder into the Products directory in your old plone site. <br />

For the new plone site it can be installed in the normal manner as the ilrt.contentmigrator
egg in the buildout.

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>
From Andreas Jung's idea
<a href="http://www.zopyx.com/blog/when-the-plone-migration-fails-doing-content-migration-only">
http://www.zopyx.com/blog/when-the-plone-migration-fails-doing-content-migration-only</a>
This conforms to the properties style of generic setup.<br /><br />

Exports content and replicates the folder structure of plone to a zope/var/structure 
folder on the file system.<br /><br />

Content gets default dublin core and workflow metadata in properties files
e.g. word.doc is exported with a separate word.doc.ini file. Whilst HTML document
content and archetypes have the properties packaged in the header of the file. 
The properties format uses the RFC822 mail format standard, which is the plone3 default 
for content marshalling, available by adding manage_FTPget to a content item url.<br /><br />

If archetypes are found their schema data is added to the properties.
