ilrt.contentmigrator Installation
=================================

Plone 2.* or earlier (export)
-----------------------------

Copy ilrt/contentmigrator/ContentMigrator to the Products directory of 
the old plone site. Restart and you should have a 'Content Migrator Tool' listed
in the right hand content drop down. Pick this and add it to the portal.

There will be a new portal_exportcontent tool in your site. Select this and choose
the Export content tab.

Click export and wait whilst you site becomes files in var/zope/structure
If you only wish to export a subsection of your site then specify the path in the 
textbox at the top of the page.

Plone 3.* or later
------------------

For plone 3 and later install using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``ilrt.contentmigrator`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        ilrt.contentmigrator
        
  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        ilrt.contentmigrator
        
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
NB: You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

On plone restart you should have the Content Migrator listed in 
http://host/plone/portal_quickinstaller. Tick it and press OK to install. 

Google sites
------------

To import or export between Plone and Google sites

Requires the install of gdata from http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/
into 2.2 or later python. 

cd to the google folder - import/export is command-line only.

Copy demo_config.py to google_config.py and edit it to point at your google account and site. 

PLONE -> GOOGLE

- Install ilrt.contentmigrator (or ContentMigrator if plone 2) in your plone instance and run the export to a structure directory on the file system.

- Set up a google site and add your google credentials and the site details to
the google_config.py file along with the path to the structure folder then run ...

> python export_to_google.py

GOOGLE -> PLONE

As above but run 

> python import_from_google.py

Then use the portal_setupcontent tool installed by contentmigrator in your plone
site to point to the google structure folder and import the google content.
