Configuration
-------------

An example of .hg/hgrc of your remote repository:

.. code-block:: cfg

    [extensions]
    poke_jenkins =

    [poke_jenkins]

    # Jenkins url
    jenkins_base_url = http://ci.example.com

    # List the jobs you want to start
    jobs = Project_Tests_Dev Project_Coverage_Dev

    # Feel free to change this parameter
    tag = foo

    # The url which Jenkins will use to clone the repository
    repo_url = ssh://code.example.com//example

    # Timeout in seconds
    timeout = 10

    # Jenkins user id
    username = foo

    # Jenkins API Token
    password = bar

    # Branch regular expression filter
    branch_regex = ^c\d{4}


Usage
-----

With given configuration above, it will call jenkins jobs to start builds:

* http://ci.example.com/job/Project_Tests_Dev?TAG=foo&NODE_ID=<mercurial commit hash>&BRANCH=<branch name>&REPO_URL=ssh://code.example.com//example

* http://ci.example.com/job/Project_Coverage_Dev?TAG=foo&NODE_ID=<mercurial commit hash>&BRANCH=<branch name>&REPO_URL=ssh://code.example.com//example

It will add basic auth headers to authenticate the calls if username and password settings are set.


Python3 support
---------------

Package itself supports python3 out of the box, but not mercurial ATM.
