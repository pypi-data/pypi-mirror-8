pymills is a collection of various useful `Python`_ utility modules
maintained by `James Mills`_. Some are written by James Mills while
others are borrowed from other sources and attributed.

.. note:: You may not find this library/package useful to you
          as I (*James Mills*) don't actively maintain this as
          a real project as such. It was my first ever `Python`_
          Package (*and the name has stuck*) and I generally
          just throw things in it that I can find no better
          place for. See the `API`_ to find anything of interest.
