Description: ofpy
        ====
        
        Command line to OmniFocus script, via email or Dropbox and Hazel
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using pip
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``sudo pip3 install ofpy``
        
        You may be able to get away without ``sudo`` if you're using a
        `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ Python installation on OSX.
        
        Obviously replace ``pip3`` with ``pip`` if you're still using python2 or
        if python3 is the default on your system (e.g. Arch).
        
        Manually
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        You should also be able to just ``chmod`` and symlink to ``ofpy.py``
        without difficulty -- that's how I as doing it for the first several
        versions. That said, if you're doing a manual installation, I'll assume
        you know what you're doing. In general:
        
        1. Download or ``git clone``
        2. Add a `shebang <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang>`__ to
           ``ofpy.py``, e.g. ``#! /usr/bin/env python3``
        3. Do something along the lines of
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            cd ofpy/ofpy
            chmod u+x ofpy.py
            ln -s $PWD/ofpy.py /usr/local/bin/ofpy
        
        Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. Run ``ofpy`` without arguments. You should see a logging message
           about creating ``~/.ofpy_config``.
        2. Edit ``~/.ofpy_config`` and fill in your values.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Inline from the command line.
        
        ``ofpy "This is my first task."``
        
        Inline from the command line without quotes (watch out for apostrophes
        and quotes)
        
        ``ofpy This is my second task.``
        
        Compose the task in your favorite CLI editor (set in config, defaults to
        vim).
        
        ``ofpy``
        
        Troubleshoting
        --------------
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Double check permissions, e.g. ``ls -l /usr/local/bin/ofpy``.
