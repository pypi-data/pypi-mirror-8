Description: A Nagios-style script that will check if the Amazon EC2 instance it is running
        on has any events scheduled, like a system reboot.
        
        Exit code 2 if any events are scheduled, 0 otherwise. Useful in combination
        with Nagios and/or NRPE.
        
        Usage:
            check_no_scheduled_ec2_events
        
        No options are given. The script assumes it is running in an EC2 instance, and
        will grab the current instance id from the instance metadata and AWS
        credentials from the current environment.
