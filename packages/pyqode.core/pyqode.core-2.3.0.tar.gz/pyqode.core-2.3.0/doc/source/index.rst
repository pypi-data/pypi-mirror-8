Welcome to the pyqode.core documentation!
=========================================

pyQode is a *flexible source code editor widget* for PyQt/PySide applications.

**pyQode is a library/widget, not an IDE**. *You can see it as an alternative
to QScintilla.*

pyQode is organised as a **namespace package** made up of the following
official packages:

  - `pyqode.core`_: core package
  - `pyqode.python`_: python support (code completion, ...)
  - `pyqode.designer`_: Starts Qt designer with all pyqode plugins

**pyqode.core** is the foundation package, it contains the base classes
(CodeEdit, Mode, Panel) and a set of builtin modes and panels that are useful
for any kind of code editor. With ``pyqode.core`` you can already create a
generic code editor (similar to gedit, leafpad, notepad++, ...) with only a
few lines of code.

This documentation will only cover the `pyqode.core`_ package.
