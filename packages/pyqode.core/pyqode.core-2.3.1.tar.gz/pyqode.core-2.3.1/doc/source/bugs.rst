Reporting bugs
==============

You can report bugs or ask question on our `bug tracker`_.

**Please, if your issue has been fixed in develop branch only, do not close it.**.
We leave our issues open while they have not been merged into the master
branch (i.e. while the fix has not been officially released).

.. note:: We are now using `waffle.io`_ to manage all pyqode issues (from all
          sub-repositories).
