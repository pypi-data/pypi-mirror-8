        ===============
        
        |Latest Version| |Build Status| |Platform|
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Linux platform(Currently support gnome and xfce)
        -  Python 2.7
        -  Requests lib
        -  Libnotify-bin(for Arch: libnotify)
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ::
        
            $ sudo pip install wonderful_bing
            $ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        -  Manually
        
        You need to set a directory to save the download pictures, end with '/'.
        
        ::
        
            $ wonderful_bing -d /path/to/save/pictures/
        
        -  Automatically(recommand)
        
        1. Add it to ``startup application``\ (in my Linux Mint16) if you power
           on your pc and power off your pc regularly, then every time you boot
           up your pc, this script will automatically run for you.
        
        2. Or use ``cron``. Let me give you an example:
        
           ::
        
               0 8 * * * env DISPLAY=:0 /usr/local/bin/wonderful_bing -d /home/lord63/pictures/bing/
        
        *we need ``env DISPLAY=:0``, otherwise the notify can't display at all,
        and remember the ``/`` at the end.*
        
        3. Or use ``anacron`` if you ofen hang up your pc instead of powering
           off it. but the original ``anacron`` will run the script in root,
           thus it may fail in setting the picture to wallpaper. Follow
           `this <http://www.wellengang.ch/?p=135>`__ to let you run ``anacron``
           as normal user. Let me give you an example, add the following line in
           ``$HOME/.anacron/anacrontab``:
        
           ::
        
               1 1 wonderful_bing env DISPLAY=:0 /usr/local/bin/wonderful_bing -d /home/lord63/pictures/bing/
        
        If you find a better way, please let me know :)
        
        Snapshots
        ---------
        
        the first time you run it:
        
        ::
        
            $ wonderful_bing -d /home/lord63/pictures/bing/
            Successfully download the picture to --> /home/lord63/pictures/bing/CascadePools.jpg
            Successfully set the picture as the wallpaper. :)
        
        if you don't set the directory:
        
        ::
        
            $ wonderful_bing
            Set the directory to save Bing's imgs first.
            For more information, use --help.
        
        if the picture has been downloaded before:
        
        ::
        
            $ wonderful_bing -d /home/lord63/pictures/bing/
            You have downloaded the picture before.
            Have a look at it --> /home/lord63/pictures/bing/CascadePools.jpg
        
        if your pc doesn't connect to the network, it will try again after 5
        mins.
        
        ::
        
            $ wonderful_bing -d /home/lord63/pictures/bing/
            ConnectionError,check your network please.
            Will try again after 5 minutes.
        
        and the notify should looks like this:
        
        .. figure:: ./wonderful_bing/img/notify.png
           :alt:
