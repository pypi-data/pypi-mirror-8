js.tinymce
**********

Introduction
============

This library packages `TinyMCE`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`TinyMCE`: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.tinymce``) are published to some URL.
