========================================

:Release: |release|

PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML2. It contains all necessary pieces for building a SAML2 service
provider or an identity provider. The distribution contains examples of both. Originally written to work in a WSGI
environment, there are extensions that allow you to use it with other frameworks.
