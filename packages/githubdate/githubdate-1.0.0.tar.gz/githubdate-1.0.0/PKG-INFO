        ==========
        githubdate
        ==========
        
        You've got dozens of pull-requests on hold. Some of them are ready to be
        merged. But as a release manager, you need to warn everyone with "merge"
        rights **not to** merge any of these pull-requests. Because you're on a hot
        lava field, you have to stabilize things, etc.
        
        Anyway. Just push a "it's not cool to merge this" status. And then, when the
        situation is cooler, just send an update with a green light.
