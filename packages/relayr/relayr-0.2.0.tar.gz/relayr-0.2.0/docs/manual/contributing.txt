Contributing 
=================

Contributions are highly welcome and much appreciated, so please do not
hesitate! Apart from bug reports we also welcome little self-contained
examples that you might find helpful for others.

The various relay SDKs are still being developped.
You can find the code of the
`Python-SDK on GitHub <https://github.com/relayr/python-sdk/>`_
which is also the place for reporting any bugs and/or patches (the latter
preferably in the form of a pull request). If you report a bug please
make sure to include information about your OS platform and Python version.

On GitHub you can also find SDKs in other repositories for other languages
or platforms such as `iOS and Mac <https://github.com/relayr/apple-sdk/>`_
and `Android <https://github.com/relayr/android-sdk>`_.

If you have more general questions you are more than welcome to post them on the
`relayr Forum <https://forum.relayr.io/>`_
