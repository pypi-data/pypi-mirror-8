Dodge
=====

Dodge is a Python library that allows easy creation of data objects.
These data objects can then be converted from and to dictionaries,
allowing easy JSON serialisation.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import dodge

    Instrument = dodge.data_class("Instrument", [
        "name",
        "material",
    ])


    saxophone = Instrument("saxophone", "brass")

    serialised_saxophone = dodge.obj_to_dict(saxophone)
    unserialised_saxophone = dodge.dict_to_obj(serialised_saxophone)

    print unserialised_saxophone.material # Prints "brass"
