--test 
From within the folder Mistral-2.0:

To build (i.e., generate the executable fzn-mistral):
$ make

Options: 
1- fzn-mistral does not use parallel threads so the option -p has no use (yet). 
2- Search annotations are not yet supported. However, we need to mention the -f option to ignore these annotations.
