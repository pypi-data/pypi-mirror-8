    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Database replication app.

    This replication is a limited row-based write/update/delete replication.
    You have to make sure the schema was created and matched between master
    and slave before the replication starts.

    Currently, only replicate from mysql master with row-based binlog is
    supported.
