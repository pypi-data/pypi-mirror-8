pylabels is a Python library for creating PDFs to print sheets of
labels. It uses the `ReportLab PDF
toolkit <http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/>`_ to produce
the PDF.

Basically, the user creates a set of specifications of the label sizes
etc, writes a callback function which does the actual drawing, and gives
these two items to a Sheet object. Items are then added to the sheet
using the add\_label() method (or add\_labels() to add all items from an
iterable).

The callback function is called once for each item, being given a
ReportLab Drawing object representing the label, its width and height,
and the item to draw on the label. Any of the standard ReportLab drawing
methods can be used, with pylabels automatically adding a clipping path
around each label to prevent it interfering with other labels.

Once all the items have been added, the labels can be saved as a PDF, or
a preview of a page can be saved as an image.

Examples
--------

The following examples are available in the demos directory on GitHub:

-  `Basic <https://github.com/blairbonnett/pylabels/blob/1.1.2/demos/basic.py>`_ - a introduction to the basic use of
   pylabels.
-  `Partial pages <https://github.com/blairbonnett/pylabels/blob/1.1.2/demos/partial_page.py>`_ - how to produce partial
   pages (i.e., pages with some of the labels previously used).
-  `Background colours <https://github.com/blairbonnett/pylabels/blob/1.1.2/demos/background_colours.py>`_ - examples of solid,
   striped and hatched backgrounds of different colours on each label.
-  `Page background <https://github.com/blairbonnett/pylabels/blob/1.1.2/demos/page_background.py>`_ - how to add a background
   image for each page.
-  `Padding <https://github.com/blairbonnett/pylabels/blob/1.1.2/demos/padding.py>`_ - how to add padding to the labels.
-  `Nametags <https://github.com/blairbonnett/pylabels/blob/1.1.2/demos/nametags.py>`_ - creates a set of nametags from the
   list of names in the names.txt file. Includes the use of two custom
   fonts, font size selection, and centred text.
-  `Image preview <https://github.com/blairbonnett/pylabels/blob/1.1.2/demos/preview.py>`_ - generates image previews of
   two of the pages from the nametags demo.
