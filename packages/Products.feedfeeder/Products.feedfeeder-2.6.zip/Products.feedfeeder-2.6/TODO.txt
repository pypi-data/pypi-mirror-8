To do:

- Fix tests when run with feedparser (FeedParser) 5.0.1, as is now
  pinned in Plone 4.2 and 4.3 alpha.  We might just need to do either
  less or more mocking in doc/feedconsuming.txt and make this use a
  real Plone Site.  Currently the mocking of portal_transforms is
  causing problems, but fixing that one simply leads to other
  problems.  All seems fine when used in a normal website.  Also,
  the tests work fine with the old feedparser 4.1.

- Get rid of extendeddatetime.py hack; but this needs a very difficult
  fix in zope DateTime, so this could take a while.  See:
  http://new.plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/20 and
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/142148
