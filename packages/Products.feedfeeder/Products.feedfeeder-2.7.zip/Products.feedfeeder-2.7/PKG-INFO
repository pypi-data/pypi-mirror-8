Description: Feedfeeder
        ==========
        
        Feedfeeder has just a few things it needs to do:
        
        - Read in a few ATOM feeds (not too many).
        
        - Create FeedFeederItems out of the entries pulled from the ATOM feeds.
          Any feed items that contain enclosures will have the enclosures
          pulled down and added as File items to the feed item.
        
        - This means figuring out which items are new, which also means having
          a good ID generating mechanism.
        
        
        Wait, no existing product?
        --------------------------
        
        There's a whole slew of RSS/ATOM reading products for zope and
        plone. None of them seemed to be a good fit. There was only one
        product that actually stored the entries in the zope database, but
        that was aimed at a lot of users individually adding a lot of feeds,
        so it needed either a separate ZEO process (old version) or a
        standalone mysql database (new version).
        
        All the other products didn't store the entries in the database, were
        old/unmaintained/etc.
        
        In a sense, we're using an existing product as we use Mark Pilgrim's
        excellent feedparser (http://feedparser.org) that'll do the actual
        ATOM reading for us.
        
        
        Product name
        ------------
        
        The product feeds the content of ATOM feeds to plone as document/file
        content types. So "feedfeeder" sort of suggested itself as a funny
        name. Fun is important :-)
        
        
        Product structure
        -----------------
        
        I'm using archgenxml to generate the boiler plate stuff. There's a
        'generate.sh' shell script that'll call archgenxml for you. Nothing
        fancy.
        
        The feedfeeder's content types are: 
          - folder.FeedfeederFolder
          - item.FeedFeederItem
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        A feedfeeder is a folder which contains all the previously-added feed
        entries as documents or files. It has a 'feeds' attribute that
        contains a list of feeds to read.
        
        Feedparser is called periodically (through a cron job?) to parse the
        feeds. The UID of the items in the feed are converted to a suitable
        filename (md5 hex hash of the atom id of the entry), that way you can
        detect whether there are new items.
        
        New items are turned into feed items.
        Feed data are filled into feed items (see field named objectInfo).
        
        Scheduled updates for feed folders
        
        Zope can be configured to periodically trigger a url call.
        In zope.conf you can use the <clock-server> directive to define a schedule and url
        with the following data::
        
          <clock-server>
             method /path_to_feedfolder/update_feed_items
             period 3600 # seconds
             user admin
             password 123
             host localhost:8080
          </clock-server>
        
        Updating all feeds once
        +++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        If your site has several feed folders and you 
        want update them all once you can do:: 
        
           <clock-server>
             method /yoursiteid/feed-mega-update
             period 3600 # seconds
             user admin
             password 123
             host localhost:8080
           </clock-server>
           
        
        Removing old feed items
        +++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        You can periodically remove feed items older than a specific number of days. For example, to remove once a week feed items older than 90 days you can do::
        
           <clock-server>
             method /yoursiteid/feed-mega-cleanup?days=90
             period 604800 # seconds
             user admin
             password 123
             host localhost:8080
           </clock-server>
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        We need Plone 4.x.  Compatibility with Plone 4.3 has been checked.
        
        If you use Plone 3, please use a Products.feedfeeder version from the
        2.0 line.  The current latest is 2.0.9.
        
        
        Upgrade notes
        -------------
        
        If you have installed Products.feedfeeder 2.1.x in Plone 4.0 or 4.1
        and you upgrade to Plone 4.2 or higher, then you will be missing some
        functionality for listing or ordering feedfeeder items in new style
        collections.  To solve this, you should go to ``portal_setup`` in the
        Zope Management Interface, visit the Import tab, select the
        "Feedfeeder registry" profile and import all steps.
        
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        The look-here-first test is the doctest at 'doc/feedfeeder-integration.txt'.
        
        Assuming you have a buildout, testing is best done with a propely set up ``bin/test`` command::
        
          bin/test -s Products.feedfeeder
        
        We are now testing with Travis:

        - Update permissions.  Protect updating a feed with the "feedfeeder:
          Update feed" permission.  Protect updating all feeds in a mega
          update with the "feedfeeder: Update all feeds" permission.  We give
          these to the Manager and Site Administrator roles in an upgrade step.

          needed at all.
          [maurits]
        
        - Update feed folder after its creation

        2.0.5 (2011-09-03)
        ------------------

          Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/36
          [maurits]
        
        - Register our own documentbyline viewlet for feed items, which

        2.0.4 (2011-03-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid DeprecationWarning on python2.6 by preferring hashlib over md5
          when available.
          [maurits]
        
        - Do not reindex the feed item when nothing has changed.  Only update
          the objectInfo field when there has been a change.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/34
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.0.3 (2011-01-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Respect the Plone setting on the 'about' information: only show the

          allowed to view the about information.
          [markvl]

        ------------------
        
        - Modified import RSS and added a new field on feed items named
          objectInfo. All feed data will be stored on this field,
          as a python dict.
          Just changing the remote RSS template, you will able to memoize
          additional info without having to modify the feed item schema.
          [dmoro]
        
        - Added an option on feed folder that let you choose to redirect
          automatically to remote resources. If you have modify permissions

        ------------------
        
        - Added @@feed-mega-update view so you can update all feed folders at
          once, for example in a clock server.
          [miohtoma]
        
        - Import HTMLParseError from the standard python HTMLParser instead of
          BeautifulSoup.  This makes feedfeeder compatible with BeautifulSoup
          3.0.x again.
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.0 (2010-07-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Solve some Plone 4 compatibility issues.
          [sureshvv]
        
        - Ignore unidentifiable entries without id or link, instead of
          throwing an AttributeError.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/26
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2010-04-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix errors when viewing a folder or item on Plone 4, while still
          keeping Plone 2.5 and Plone 3 compatibility.
          Refs http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/25

        1.0 (2009-12-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Some summaries are a snippet from the full content, and then they
          can contain broken html; in this case we are now saving the raw
          broken html, parsing it only when possible.
          [lucmult]
        
        
        1.0rc7 (2009-11-06)
        -------------------
        
        - Improved the translations stuffs
          [lucmult]
        
        - Changed the way to translate xml/html entities from summary, now
          using BeautifulSoup. Old way was breaking with some non ascii
          characters.
          [lucmult]
        
        - When setting the text of a feed item during updating, store the
          mimetype as well if it is a supported one.
          Refs http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/24
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0rc6 (2009-09-21)
        -------------------
        
        - Bug fix: curly quotes getting mangled when Descriptions are built.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/7
          (Merged branch maurits-cleaner-entityrefs-in-description.)
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0rc5 (2009-07-02)
        -------------------
        
        - Do not add our skin layer to Plone Default and certainly not to
          Plone Tableless, but just to all (*).  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0rc4 (2009-06-18)
        -------------------
        
        - When both the updated and published date of an item is not known,
          take today as the date when first adding it.  When updating, do not
          change the original item.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/21
          [maurits]
        
        - Read tags/categories/keywords of feed items and store them on the
          created content item.  No Archetypes field, just a simple getter and
          setter called feed_tags.   Idea: Robin Harms Oredsson.
          [maurits]
        
        - DateTime.SyntaxError is thrown with some very common US
          Daylight Saving zones, such as EDT. We now wrap the DateTime parsing
          of feeds, to try to recognise those zones before politely giving up, using
          maurits' fix, below.
          [russf]
        
        - Catch DateTime.SyntaxError when parsing the updated and published
          dates of an entry and continue with the next entry.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/18
          [maurits]
        
        - Avoid swallowing too much exceptions when applying our GenericSetup
          profile.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/19
          [maurits]
        
        1.0rc3 (2008-10-04)
        -------------------
        
        - Moved profile definition from python to GenericSetup.  Profile is
          now not 'profile-feedfeeder:default' but
          'profile-Products.feedfeeder:default'.  [maurits]
        
        - In the Extensions/ dir: removed Install.py and renamed AppInstall.py
          to install.py.  [maurits]
        
        - Made feed item updated date available for Collections/Smart Folders.
          [maurits]
        
        - Extensions/AppInstall.py: first try installing our own profile in
          the Plone 3 way and when that fails try the Plone 2.5 way.
          [maurits]
        
        - Removed own feedparser.py.  Instead added an install_requires
          dependency on FeedParser in setup.py.  [maurits]
        
        - Moved fix for feeds starting with 'feed:' instead of 'http:' from
          feedparser.py to utilities.py, so we use an unchanged feedparser.py
          again.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 rc 2 (2008-07-23)
        ---------------------
