"""Juju GUI server bundles deployment support.

The following functions are used by the Juju GUI server to validate
and start bundle deployments. The validate and import_bundle
operations represents the public API: they are directly called in the
GUI server bundles support code, which also takes care of handling any
exception they can raise.  Those functions are blocking, and therefore
the GUI server executes them in separate processes.  See
<https://code.launchpad.net/~juju-gui/charms/precise/juju-gui/trunk>.
