Description: eGenix mxODBC Connect Client - Python Database Interface
        --------------------------------------------------------
        
        mxODBC Connect is a client-server product from eGenix that enables
        fast, easy and secure access from any Python application to remote
        databases on your network, using the same well-established mxODBC
        Python DB-API 2.0 compatible API.
        
        Cross-Platform Database Access
        ------------------------------
        
        Unlike our mxODBC Python ODBC Interface, mxODBC Connect is designed as
        client-server application, so you no longer need to find production
        quality ODBC drivers for all the client platforms you target with your
        Python application.
        
        Instead you use an easy to install royalty-free Python client library
        which connects directly to the mxODBC Connect database server over the
        network.
        
        This makes mxODBC Connect the ideal basis for writing cross-platform
        multi-tier database applications in Python, especially if you develop
        applications that need to communicate with databases such as MS SQL
        Server and MS Access, Oracle Database, IBM DB2 and Informix, Sybase
        ASE and Sybase Anywhere, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SAP MaxDB and many more,
        that run on remote Windows or Linux machines.
        
        Centralized Database Access Administration
        ------------------------------------------
        
        By removing the need to install and configure ODBC drivers on the
        client side, mxODBC Connect greatly simplifies setup, rollout and
        configuration of database driven client applications, while at the
        same time making the network communication between client and database
        server more efficient and more secure.
        
        Server Packages
