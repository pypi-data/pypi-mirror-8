==========
This is a pure Python OTR implementation; it does not bind to libotr.

Install the potr Python module:

    sudo python setup.py install

**Dependencies**: pycrypto >= 2.1 (see `dlitz/pycrypto <https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto>`_)

Usage Notes
===========
This module uses pycrypto's RNG. If you use this package in your application and your application
uses ``os.fork()``, make sure to call ``Crypto.Random.atfork()`` in both the parent and the child process.
