Description: If you have any LSI RAID cards in your infrastructure which predate the acquisition
        of 3ware, you are undoubtedly familiar with MegaCli64, the horrible program which LSI
        provides for administrating these cards. Its lack of user-friendliness is legendary. Some
        egregious examples:
        
         - case sensitivity + inconsistent case (example: `/opt/MegaRAID/MegaCli/MegaCli64 -LDInfo -Lall -aALL`)
         - wildly inconsistent, hard-to-parse output (`BBU GasGauge Status: 0x0128`)
         - misleading summary information (components like BBUs will often simultaneously report `State: Optimal` and `Pack is about to fail & should be replaced`, which seems like they should never occur at the same time)
        
        This library seeks to wrap MegaCli and MegaCli64 and provide an object-oriented interface
        to see what the heck is actually going on with your controller.
        
        At this time, it doesn't support CHANGING anything, just displaying data. This makes it
        suitable to use in, e.g., nagios checks, but you still have to remember how to actually
        change settings. That might change in the future.
