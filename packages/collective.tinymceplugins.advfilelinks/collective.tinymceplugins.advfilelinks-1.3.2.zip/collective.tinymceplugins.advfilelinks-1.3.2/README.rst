Introduction
============

This is a plugin for `TinyMCE`__ editor for Plone.

__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.TinyMCE/

It will replace in the less obtrusive way the standard *plonelink* plugin, providing a version that
handle in a different way links to File and Image contents.

Detailed documentation
======================

When the link is not internal or not to a file nothing will change and standard Plone behavior is kept.

When you link a *file* or an *image* inside the Plone site you commonly get this XHTML code...::

    <a class="internal-link" href="my-pdf">Download the document</a>

Instead you'll get this...::

    <a class="internal-link internal-link-tofile" href="my-pdf"
       type="application/pdf" title="pdf, 146.2 kB">Download the document</a>

(the same if you have enabled "*Link using UIDs*")

The plugin also add a CSS to your Plone site that:

* Add the image icon based on file's mimetype, on the left of the link (if on IE, need IE 7 or better)
* After the linked text will be added a `text generated with CSS`__, with the same content you find in the
  *title*, put in bracket (need IE 8 or better).
  IE users with old versions still get's some additional information thanks to the *title* HTML attribute.

   What you will find inside TinyMCE

Customize format of link to contents
------------------------------------

Plone normally doesn't manage link to file is special ways (it simply generate a link to the base URL of
the content). 

This plugin will add a new control inside advanced settings:

.. figure:: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.tinymceplugins.advfilelinks/collective.tinymceplugins.advfilelinks-1.1.0-03.png/image_preview
   :alt: Advanced settings
   :target: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/collective.tinymceplugins.advfilelinks/collective.tinymceplugins.advfilelinks-1.1.0-03.png
   
   The "Link format" option, inside advanced settings

Playing with those options can change the format of the generated link, adding a suffix to it.

*Direct link to content* (TinyMCE default)
    Do not add any suffix.
*Link to content's preview* (default for *Image*)
    A link to a view of the content
*Link to download content* (default for *File*)
    Force the download of the file (or image)

Most of the time "*Link to download content*" is like "*Direct link to content*": calling ``url/to/a/file`` is like
calling ``url/to/a/file/at_download/file``, but without an explicit ``at_download/file`` sometimes the target file
can be opened by browser plugins (expecially common for images, where ``url/to/an/image`` will open the image in
the browser).

The "*Link to content' preview*" can ne used to create links that are not opening the attachment, but move user to
the Plone content.

Extending for custom contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let say you are using a new Plone content type, like a Video. You want that TinyMCE links to video contents in a
custom way.

What you need is to provide a new adapter for the ``IFileSuffixes`` interface::

  <adapter
        for="your.package.content.IYourVideoType
             zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IHTTPRequest"
        provides="collective.tinymceplugins.advfilelinks.interfaces.IFileSuffixes"
        factory=".adapters.YourVideoTypeDownloadSuffix"
        />

The provide the Python adapter code::

    class YourVideoTypeDownloadSuffix(object):
        implements(IFileSuffixes)
    
        def __init__(self, context, request):
            self.context = context
            self.request = request
            self.download_suffix = '/video_download'
            self.view_suffix = '/preview_video'
            self.default_suffix = 2

You can provide three options:

``download_suffix``
    Provide the suffix to be added when using "*Link to download content*"
    for your content.
    
    Set the value to ``None`` and no suffix wil be added or used
``view_suffix``
    Provide the suffix to be added when using "*Link to content's preview*"
    for your content.
    
    Set the value to ``None`` and no suffix wil be added or used
``default_suffix``
    Provide ad integer value to be used for settings the default combo box option.
    Use 1 for the first combo option, 2 for the second, and so on.

You can use this feature also for overriding default behavior for File and Image contents.

Dependencies
============

This product has been tested with:

* Plone 3.3.5 and TinyMCE 1.1.12
* Plone 4.2.4 and TinyMCE 1.2.15

.. Warning::
    This product will **not work** on Plone 4.3 or on every other Plone versions that use
    Products.TinyMCE 1.3 or better. Sorry... maybe in future!
    
    Why? Products.TinyMCE 1.3 has been rewritten from scratch.

Internet Explorer 9 users
-------------------------

Products.TinyMCE 1.2 and below suffer of knows problems with IE version 9 (and above).
Those problems have ben fixed in Products.TinyMCE 1.3 but, as said above, this plugin will
not work on version 1.3.

Instead of upgrade you can then apply one of the `knows workarounds`__.
