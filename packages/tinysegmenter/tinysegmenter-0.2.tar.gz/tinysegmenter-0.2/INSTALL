Installation Instructions
*************************

You have 3 ways to use the `tinysegmenter` package.

-------------------------------

If you have the ``pip`` command, you can have the last version of the package by running:

$ pip install tinysegmenter

Or to upgrade your existing package:

$ pip install --upgrade tinysegmenter

Installing from The Archived Package
------------------------------------

Build this python binding in a single command using a typical setup.py:
$ ./setup.py install

All typical options of a Python setup are available. For details, check:
$ ./setup.py install --help

For instance to install in your locale prefix, if this one is /home/me/.local/:
$ ./setup.py install --prefix=/home/me/.local/

Copying the Files over to your source code
------------------------------------------

`tinysegmenter` is made only of 1 file: ``tinysegmenter.py`` that you will find in the ``src/`` directory of this package.
Feel free to copy it and import it manually.
