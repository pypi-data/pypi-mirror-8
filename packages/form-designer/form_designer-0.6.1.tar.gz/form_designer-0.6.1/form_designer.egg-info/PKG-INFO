        Form Designer - a simple form designer for FeinCMS

        This form designer does not try to offer every last configuration possibility
        of Django's forms, just through the administration interface instead of
        directly in Python code. Instead, it strives to be a tool which everyone can
        use right away, without the need for long explanations.
        
        It offers a small set of predefined input fields such as:
        
        * Text fields (One line and multi line widgets possible)
        * E-mail address fields
        * Checkboxes
        * Dropdowns
        * Radio Buttons
        * Multiple selection checkboxes
        * Hidden input fields
        
        Every field can optionally be declared mandatory, default values and help texts
        are available too. That's it.
        
        By default, form data is sent by e-mail to a freely definable e-mail address
        and stored in the database (a CSV export of saved submissions is provided too).
        It is possible to add your own actions, but that's not documented yet. These
        actions aren't hardcoded -- they can be freely defined for every form defined
        through this form designer.
        
        
        Configuring the export
        ======================
        
        The CSV export of form submissions uses the Python's CSV module, the Excel
        dialect and UTF-8 encoding by default. If your main target is Excel, you should
        probably add the following setting to work around Excel's abysmal handling of
        CSV files encoded in anything but latin-1::
        
            FORM_DESIGNER_EXPORT = {
                'encoding': 'latin-1',
            }
        
        You may add additional keyword arguments here which will be used during the
        instantiation of ``csv.writer``.
        
        
        ReCaptcha
        =========
        
        To enable [ReCaptcha](http://www.google.com/recaptcha) install
        [django-recaptcha](https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha) and add
        `captcha` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`. This will automatically add a ReCaptcha
        field to the form designer. For everything else read through the
        django-recaptcha readme.
        
        
        Override field types
        ====================
        
        Define ``FORM_DESIGNER_FIELD_TYPES`` in your settings file like::
        
            FORM_DESIGNER_FIELD_TYPES = 'your_project.form_designer_config.FIELD_TYPES'
        
        In ``your_project.form_designer_config.py`` something like::
        
            from django import forms
            from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
        
            FIELD_TYPES = [
                ('text', _('text'), forms.CharField),
                ('email', _('e-mail address'), forms.EmailField),
            ]
