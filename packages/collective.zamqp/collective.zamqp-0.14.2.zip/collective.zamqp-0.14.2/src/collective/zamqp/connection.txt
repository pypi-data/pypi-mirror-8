Connection
==========

`BrokerConnection <#collective.zamqp.connection.BrokerConnection>`_ is an AMQP connection utility that enables connection to an AMQP server (aka message broker) via a specific virtual host.

Its parameters depend on the broker configuration/setup. See `IBrokerConnection <#collective.zamqp.interfaces.IBrokerConnection>`_ attributes for the available parameters.

To ease connection creation we also define a factory, see `IBrokerConnectionFactory <#collective.zamqp.interfaces.IBrokerConnectionFactory>`_
