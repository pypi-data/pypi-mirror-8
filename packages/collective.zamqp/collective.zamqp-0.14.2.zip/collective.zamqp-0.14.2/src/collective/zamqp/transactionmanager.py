    """Mix-in class that provides transaction management support

    A sub class should call self._register() whenever it performs any
    transaction-dependent operations (e.g. sql statements).

    The sub class will need to override _finish, to finalize work,
    _abort, to roll-back work, and perhaps _begin, if any work is
    needed at the start of a transaction.

    A subclass that uses locking during transaction commit must
    defined a sortKey() method.

    The VTM variety can be mixed-in with persistent classes.
