        AMQP integration for Zope2 (and Plone)
        ======================================
        
        **collective.zamqp** acts as a *Zope Server* by co-opting Zope's asyncore
        mainloop (using asyncore-supporting AMQP-library
        `pika <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika>`_),
        and injecting consumed messages as *requests* to be handled by ZPublisher
        (exactly like Zope ClockServer).
        
        Therefore AMQP-messages are handled (by default) in a similar environment to
        regular HTTP-requests: ZCA-hooks, events and everything else behaving normally.
        
        This package is an almost complete rewrite of
        `affinitic.zamqp <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/affinitic.zamqp>`_,
        but preserves its ideas on how to setup AMQP-messaging
        by configuring only producers and consumers.
        
        TODO
            * rewrite documentation to reflect the new design
            * update affinitic.zamqp's tests for the new design
        
        While we are still documenting and testing **collective.zamqp**,
        you may want to take a look at `collective.zamqpdemo
        <http://github.com/datakurre/collective.zamqpdemo/>`_ for an example of use.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        A common setup includes a producer and a worker instance which are both
        connected to the same rabbitmq server.
        
        Buildout
        --------
        
        Both instances can be easily configured using buildout::
        
            [buildout]
            parts =
                instance
                worker
        
            ...
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            http-address = 8080
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.zamqp
        
            ...
            zope-conf-additional =
                %import collective.zamqp
                <amqp-broker-connection>
                    connection_id   superuser
                    hostname        my.rabbithostname.com
                    port            5672
                    username        guest
                    password        guest
                    heartbeat       120
                    keepalive       60
                </amqp-broker-connection>
        
            [worker]
            <= instance
            http-address = 8081
            zserver-threads = 1
            environment-vars =
                ZAMQP_LOGLEVEL INFO
            zope-conf-additional =
                ${instance:zope-conf-additional}
                <amqp-consuming-server>
                    connection_id   superuser
                    site_id         Plone
                    user_id         admin
                </amqp-consuming-server>
        
        Explanation of configuration parameters
        ---------------------------------------
        
        - amqp-broker-connection
        
          ``connection_id``
                Connection id, which is the registered name of the created
                global BrokerConnection-utility.
          ``hostname``  (optional)
                Hostname or IP Address of RabbitMQ server to connect to, default to
                ``localhost``.
          ``port``  (optional)
                TCP port of RabbitMQ server to connect to, defaults to ``5672``.
          ``virtual_host``  (optional)
                RabbitMQ virtual host to use, defaults to ``/``.
          ``username``  (optional)
                Plain text username for RabbitMQ connection, defaults to ``guest``.
          ``password``  (optional)
                Plain text password for RabbitMQ connection, defaults to ``guest``.
          ``heartbeat``  (optional)
                AMQP heartbeat interval in seconds, defaults to ``0`` to disable
                heartbeat.
          ``keepalive``  (optional)
                Register producer, consumer, view and clock-server with the given
                integer timeout in seconds to keep the connection alive. Defaults
                ``0``.
          ``prefetch_count`` (optional)
                AMQP channel prefetch count limit, defaults to 0 for no limit.
        
        - amqp-consuming-server
        
          ``connection_id``
                The name of a global utility providing configured IBrokerConnection. A
                consuming server will serve consumers registered for its connection id
                only.
          ``scheme``  (optional)
                Configure URL schema for virtual rewriting using VirtualHostMonster,
                default is ``http``. Will be ignored if no ``hostname`` is given.
          ``hostname``  (optional)
                Hostname which will be passed into fake request. When calling
                ``object.absolute_url()`` in a consuming server you'll receive this
                hostname. URL will be rewritten using VirtualHostMonster using following
                scheme::
        
                    /VirtualHostBase/{scheme}/{hostname}:{port}/{site_id}/VirtualHostRoot/...
        
                If a hostname is configured, VirtualHostMonster will be invoked,
                ``socket.gethostname()`` will be used else.
          ``port`` (optional)
                Configure port for virtual rewriting using VirtualHostMonster,
                default is ``80``. Will be ignored if no ``hostname`` is given.
          ``use_vhm`` (optional)
               Create VirtualHostMonster-wrapped method calls when hostname is set. VHM
               is used to tell portal the configured real public hostname and to hide
               portal's id from path. Defaults to *on*.
          ``vhm_method_prefix`` (optional)
               Explicitly set the VHM method prefix for AMQP-based requests. Most
               typical options may look like:
        
               * /VirtualHostBase/https/example.com:443/Plone
               * /VirtualHostBase/https/example.com:443/Plone/VirtualHostRoot
               * /VirtualHostBase/https/example.com:443/Plone/VirtualHostRoot/_vh_subsite
        
               Note: This overrides the default implicit VHM-support by setting scheme,
               hostname, port and use_vhm, but will still require use_vhm enabled to be
               active. Empty value fallbacks to the old default use_vhm-behavior.
          ``site_id``
                The id of a site, which should be the context when consuming the AMQP
                messages, which the consumers of a consuming server consume. If a
                ``hostname`` is given, this will be used for VirtualHostMonster
                rewrites.
          ``user_id``  (optional)
                Optional user id of the Plone user, whose privileges are used to consume
                the messages. By default, the messages are consumed as Anonymous User
                calling trusted filesystem code.
        
        
        Configuring logging
        -------------------
        
        You may want to in/decrease ``collective.zamqp`` loglevel which can easily be
        done by passing an environment variable into worker instance as seen in
        buildout example above::
        
            [worker]
            ...
            environment-vars =
                ZAMQP_LOGLEVEL INFO
            ...
        
        Valid parameters are:
        
        - DEBUG
        - INFO

        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bugs in registering connections and consuming servers in ZAMQP layer.
        
        - Added 'text/csv' serializer (for serializing iterable container of

          tuple of dictionaries)
        
        0.9.3 (2012-11-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Enhanced 'runAsyncTest' to accept 'loop_timeout' and 'loop_count' parameters.
        - Fixed optional json-serializer to try to import 'json' at first and only then
          'simplejson'.
        
        0.9.2 (2012-09-18)

          Added consuming server for ZAMQP-layer.
        
        0.9.1 (2012-09-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed to not set correlation_id-property for message if the given
          correlation_id is None.
        
        0.9.0 (2012-09-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Added alias 'Producer.register' for VTM._register.
        - Renamed 'connected'-property to 'is_connect'.
        
        0.8.1 (2012-09-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed queue length helpers to use BlockingChannel-helper properly.
        
        0.8.0 (2012-09-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed consumers without marker interface not to start consuming.
        - Enhanced undolog for transactions by 'zamqp-consumer'-view.
        - Fixed consuming view to annotate transaction with the user configured for the
          current consuming service.
        - Added separate auto_delete-setting for exchanges and queues. Previously
          auto_delete was set as negation of durability, which remains the default.
        - Added connection configuration to default with implicit default producer
          registration (= producer with the same name/id as the connection, but no any
          special routing).
        - Added support for custom 'x-cookie-auth' header. Its value will be set to
          value of '__ac' cookie for AMQP request to allow PAS-authentication for
          logged in user (e.g. to support authenticated asyncronous tasks).
        - Added __len__ for consumer and producer for getting the queue length (if the
          related queue is defined) using blocking channel.
        - Added BlockingChannel wrapper to be used with 'with' statement to create
          separate blocking connections for quick raw AMQP-operations.
        - Fixed to never declare queue starting with 'amq.', which is reserved prefix
          in RabbitMQ. Allow empty queue names to support automatic (broker-generated)
          queue-names.
        - Fixed to never declare RabbitMQ default exchanges (declarig of any
          'amq.'-starting exchange will be skipped).
        - Added json-serializer (when either json or simplejson can be imported).
        
        0.7.18 (2012-08-10)
        -------------------
        
        - Bug fixes.
          [malthe]
        - Added plone.testing layer for RabbitMQ + Zope. Added a dummy test for the
          layer. Enabled RabbitMQ-parts in test buildout.
        - Fixed consumers and producers to use the default exchange by default to allow
          the easiest possible configuration for the use of the default exchange only.
        
        0.7.17 (2012-05-21)
        -------------------
        
        - Added transaction aware reject to message.
        - Added site_id-substitution support for consumer name to make consuming
          service and site specific consumers available for lookup.
        - Fixed to not crash if connection if not defined. Just warn.
        - Fixed grok.name-magic to work more similarly in consumer (name is taken as
          queue) as in producer (name is taken as routing_key).
        - Refactored ping to use simple dynamic properties for routing_key and queue.
        - Refactored producer, consumer and connection init to allow configuration
          using simple dynamic properties.
        - Refactored producer, consumer and connection init to allow configuration
          using simple dynamic properties.
        - Dropped 'magical' buildout name from keepalive's ping queues.
        - Removed 'magical' proxying of message body's properties before we rely on it.
        
        0.7.16 (2012-05-04)
        -------------------
        
        - Forced correlation_id to be str.
        - Changed default serializer from 'text/plain' to 'pickle'.
        - Fixed added dependencies to work on Plone 4.0.x.
        
        0.7.14 (2012-05-02)
        -------------------
        
        - Fixed to requeue message when transaction of successful handling is aborted
          (e.g. due to ZODB conflict error).
        
        0.7.12 (2012-04-25)
        -------------------
        
        - Added support for sauna.reload.
        
        0.7.11 (2012-04-18)
        -------------------
        
        - Changed ping to be logged on debug-level instead of info-level.
