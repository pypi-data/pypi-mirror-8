0.9.5 (2013-02-20)

0.9.4 (2012-11-27)
------------------

- Fixed bugs in registering connections and consuming servers in ZAMQP layer.

  dictionaries into RFC4180 CSV data and deserializing such messages into
  tuple of dictionaries)

0.9.3 (2012-11-27)
------------------

- Enhanced 'runAsyncTest' to accept 'loop_timeout' and 'loop_count' parameters.
- Fixed optional json-serializer to try to import 'json' at first and only then
  'simplejson'.

------------------

- Pinned z3c.unconfigure==1.0.1.
- Added test fixture to be used with ZSERVER-fixtures to support Selenium-testing.

  Added consuming server for ZAMQP-layer.

0.9.1 (2012-09-18)
------------------

- Fixed to not set correlation_id-property for message if the given
  correlation_id is None.

0.9.0 (2012-09-17)
------------------

- Added alias 'Producer.register' for VTM._register.
- Renamed 'connected'-property to 'is_connect'.

0.8.1 (2012-09-06)
------------------

- Fixed queue length helpers to use BlockingChannel-helper properly.

0.8.0 (2012-09-06)
------------------

- Fixed consumers without marker interface not to start consuming.
- Enhanced undolog for transactions by 'zamqp-consumer'-view.
- Fixed consuming view to annotate transaction with the user configured for the
  current consuming service.
- Added separate auto_delete-setting for exchanges and queues. Previously
  auto_delete was set as negation of durability, which remains the default.
- Added connection configuration to default with implicit default producer
  registration (= producer with the same name/id as the connection, but no any
  special routing).
- Added support for custom 'x-cookie-auth' header. Its value will be set to
  value of '__ac' cookie for AMQP request to allow PAS-authentication for
  logged in user (e.g. to support authenticated asyncronous tasks).
- Added __len__ for consumer and producer for getting the queue length (if the
  related queue is defined) using blocking channel.
- Added BlockingChannel wrapper to be used with 'with' statement to create
  separate blocking connections for quick raw AMQP-operations.
- Fixed to never declare queue starting with 'amq.', which is reserved prefix
  in RabbitMQ. Allow empty queue names to support automatic (broker-generated)
  queue-names.
- Fixed to never declare RabbitMQ default exchanges (declarig of any
  'amq.'-starting exchange will be skipped).
- Added json-serializer (when either json or simplejson can be imported).

0.7.18 (2012-08-10)
-------------------

- Bug fixes.
  [malthe]
- Added plone.testing layer for RabbitMQ + Zope. Added a dummy test for the
  layer. Enabled RabbitMQ-parts in test buildout.
- Fixed consumers and producers to use the default exchange by default to allow
  the easiest possible configuration for the use of the default exchange only.

0.7.17 (2012-05-21)
-------------------

- Added transaction aware reject to message.
- Added site_id-substitution support for consumer name to make consuming
  service and site specific consumers available for lookup.
- Fixed to not crash if connection if not defined. Just warn.
- Fixed grok.name-magic to work more similarly in consumer (name is taken as
  queue) as in producer (name is taken as routing_key).
- Refactored ping to use simple dynamic properties for routing_key and queue.
- Refactored producer, consumer and connection init to allow configuration
  using simple dynamic properties.
- Refactored producer, consumer and connection init to allow configuration
  using simple dynamic properties.
- Dropped 'magical' buildout name from keepalive's ping queues.
- Removed 'magical' proxying of message body's properties before we rely on it.

0.7.16 (2012-05-04)

0.7.9 (2012-04-16)
