MessageWrapper
==============

A MessageWrapper is an adapter that wraps an incoming message, enable transaction support and defered acknoledgement.

This means that we a message is received it is registered in the transaction so that if someone acknoledge the message, the acknoledgement will be send to the message broker only if the transaction is correctly commited. Also if a message is acknoledge and for some reason the transaction is aborted, the message acknoledgement never gets sent.
