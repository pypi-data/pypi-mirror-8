Change log
==========

1.6 2014-12-23 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Add namedlist._update(), similar to dict.update(). Thanks to Arthur
  Skowronek (issue #23).

* Add namedlist._replace(), similar to namedtuple._replace (issue
  #24).

1.5 2014-05-20 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Support slices in namedlist.__getattr__ (issue #22).

1.4 2014-03-14 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Add MANIFEST.in to MANIFEST.in, so it will be included in sdists
  (issue #21).

1.3 2014-03-12 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Support unicode type and field names in Python 2.x (issue #19). The
  identifiers still must be ASCII only, but you can pass them as
  unicode. This is useful for code that needs to run under both Python
  2 and Python 3.

1.2 2014-02-13 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Produce an RPM named python-namedlist (issue #17).

* Add namedtuple (issue #10). Passes all of the collections.namedtuple
  tests, except those related to _source. Those tests don't apply
  given our different approach to dynamic class creation. All other
  collections.namedtuple tests have been copied to our test suite.

1.1 2014-02-07 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Added __dict__ so vars() will be supported.

* Fixed pickling from another module (issue #14).

* Moved tests to a separate file (issue #15).

1.0 2014-02-04 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Declare the API stable and release version 1.0.

* Support python 2.6 (issue #8). The doctests don't pass because
  OrderedDict isn't available until 2.7.

0.4 2014-02-04 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Add docstring (issue #7).

* Fixed README.txt typos (thanks pombredanne on bitbucket).

0.3 2014-01-29 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Removed documentation left over from recordtype.

* Make instances unhashable (issue #2).

* For python3, use str.isidentifier (issue #1).

* Reorganize code for name checking. No functional changes.

* Make instances iterable (issue #3).

* Add collections.Sequence ABC (issue #4).

* Have "python setup.py test" also run doctests (issue #5).

0.2 2014-01-28 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Added MANIFEST.in.

* Hopefully fixed a problem with .rst formatting in CHANGES.txt.

0.1 2014-01-28 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Initial release.

* Based off my recordtype project, but uses ast generation instead of
  building up a string and exec-ing it. This has a number of advantages:

  - Supporting both python2 and python3 is easier. exec has the
    anti-feature of having different syntax in the two languages.

  - Adding additional features is easier, because I can write in real
    Python instead of having to write the string version, and deal
    with all of the escaping and syntax errors.

* Added FACTORY, to allow namedlist to work even with mutable defaults.
