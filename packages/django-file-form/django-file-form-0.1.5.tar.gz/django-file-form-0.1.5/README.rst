Django file form
================

**Django-file-form** helps you to write forms with a pretty ajax upload.

Features:

-  You can easily add an ajax file-upload to a form.
-  The ajax upload works the same as an html upload.

   -  This means that you don't have to change your code to support ajax
      upload.

-  Supports single and multiple file upload.

The project is hosted on
`github <https://github.com/mbraak/django-file-form>`__.

Works with Django 1.4 and 1.5.

Usage
-----

**1 Install django-file-form**

::

    pip install django-file-form

**2 Include the app in your settings**

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        â€¦
        'django_file_form'
    ]

**3 Add the app to your urls**

In this example we use the url **upload/**. You can use a different url
if you like.

::

    urlpatterns = patterns(
        '',
        url(r'^upload/', include('django_file_form.urls')),
    )

**4 Add FileFormMixin to your form**

::

    from django_file_form.forms import FileFormMixin

    class ExampleForm(FileFormMixin, forms.Form):
        pass

**5 Add a UploadedFileField**

::

    from django_file_form.forms import FileFormMixin, UploadedFileField

    class ExampleForm(FileFormMixin, forms.Form):
        input_file = UploadedFileField()

**6 Include fileuploader.js and file\_form.js in your template**

::

     <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}ajaxuploader/js/fileuploader.js"></script>
     <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}file_form/file_form.js"></script>

By the way, you must also include jquery.

**7 Call the initUploadFields javascript function**

::

     <form id="example-form" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form }}
     </form>

     <script>
        $(function() {
            initUploadFields($('#example-form'));
        });
     </script>

**8 Handle uploaded files**

::

    class ExampleFormView(generic.FormView):
        template_name = 'example_form.html'
        form_class = forms.ExampleForm

        def form_valid(self, form):
            input_file = form.cleaned_data['input_file']

            return super(ExampleFormView, self).form_valid(form)

**9 Delete temporary files**

::

    class ExampleFormView(generic.FormView):
        template_name = 'example_form.html'
        form_class = forms.ExampleForm

        def form_valid(self, form):
            input_file = form.cleaned_data['input_file']

            self.delete_temporary_files()

            return super(ExampleFormView, self).form_valid(form)
