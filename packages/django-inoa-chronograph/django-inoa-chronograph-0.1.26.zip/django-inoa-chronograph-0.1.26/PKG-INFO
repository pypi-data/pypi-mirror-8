Description: Django-Chronograph
        ==================
        
        Chronograph is a simple application that allows you to schedule management commands to be run at regular intervals.
        Schedules can be defined in Django's built-in admin interface. Requires cron or a similar tool (e.g. Windows Task Scheduler).
        
        Chronograph has been forked by Inoa (http://www.inoa.com.br) so we could continue to update and maintain the library.
        The former version in PyPI was out of date and apparently no longer mantained. Multiple forks exist around the internet
        (mainly in GitHub), and we hope to eventually combine the best from all of them.
