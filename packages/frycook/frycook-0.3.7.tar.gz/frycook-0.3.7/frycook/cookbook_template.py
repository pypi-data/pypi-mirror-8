Cookbooks are sets of recipes to apply to a server to create systems made up of
subsystems.
'''


class Cookbook(object):
    '''
    The Cookbook class is the base class for all cookbooks to be created
    from.  If you over-ride any of the built-in functions, be sure to
    call the base class functions so that all the good stuff still
    happens.  You will probably not need to sub-class any of the base
    functions in your cookbooks, though.  They will all be called by
    frycooker as necessary.  All you need to do is to fill the
    class-level variable recipe_list with class objects for recipes that
    you want to run when applying the cookbook.  The recipes will be
    applied in the order they're defined in the list.

    Example::

      from frycook import Cookbook

      from recipes import RecipeNginx
      from recipes import RecipeExampleCom

      class CookbookWeb(Cookbook):
          recipe_list = [RecipeNginx,
                         RecipeExampleCom]

    '''
    recipe_list = []

    def __init__(self, settings, environment, ok_to_be_rude, no_prompt):
        '''
        Initialize the cookbook object with the settings and environment
        dictionaries.

        :type settings: dict
        :param settings: settings dictionary
        :type environment: dict
        :param environment: metadata dictionary
        :type ok_to_be_rude: boolean
        :param ok_to_be_rude: is it ok to interrupt your users?
        :type no_prompt: boolean
        :param no_prompt: should we prompt the user?
