Description: CKAN OpenSpending
        =================
        
        A `CKAN <http://ckan.org>`__ extension which automatically uploads
        budget data packages to the OpenSpending platform. This builds upon the
        `ckanext-budgets <https://github.com/tryggvib/ckanext-budgets>`__
        extensions which does the heavylifting of creating and marking resources
        as budget data packages.
        
        When a resource has been marked as a budget data package, this extension
        will pick it up from there and submit it for automatic loading into
        OpenSpending.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Simply clone this library and run
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Then add ``openspending`` to the list in ``ckan.plugins`` in your CKAN
        configuration file. Restart your webserver and budget data will now be
        automatically loaded for you.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        There are two required configurations which must be added to your CKAN
        configuration file.
        
        -  **ckan.site\_url** - The URL for the site
        -  **openspending.apikey** - The API key for the user on OpenSpending
           which will be used to load the data
