Description: # babel
        
        The `babel` command line interface provides a single command for sending *messages* to *endpoints*. Endpoints can (currently) be HTTP addresses, SMS numbers, user defined aliases, or (planned) public keys and hashes.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Send a text message:
        ```
        babel 4041234567 "Ohai thar"
        ```
        
        Use an alias:
        ```
        babel bob "Wazzaap!"
        ```
        
        Make an HTTP request:
        ```
        babel -r http://ipinfo.io/json
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        To send SMS messages, you'll first need to set up a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) account. Follow the instructions for your platform, then run
        ```
        babel YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER Hello World
        ```
        and edit `~/.babel/sms.toml` with your Twilio account settings. Save it and try again.
