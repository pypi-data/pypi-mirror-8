The package *cypari* is a Python wrapper for the `PARI library
<http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/>`_, a computer algebra system for
number theory computations.  It is derived from the `corresponding
component
<http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/libs/sage/libs/pari/gen.html>`_
of `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org>`_, but is independent of the rest of
Sage and can be used with any recent version of Python.
