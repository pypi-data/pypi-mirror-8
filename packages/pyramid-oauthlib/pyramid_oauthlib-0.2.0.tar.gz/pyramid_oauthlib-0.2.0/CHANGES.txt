0.2.0 (2014-11-21)
==================

Features
--------

- Expose `add_oauth_param` as a directive on `Configurator` instances.
  OAuthLib code typically assumes these attributes exist on the request
  instance. Exposing this directive allows custom extensions to be more
  portable to non-Pyramid code by avoiding the use of `request.params`
  in favor of the transparent attribute access pattern of OAuthLib
  request instances.

- Registration of new grant, response, and token types, (optionally)
  using dotted name resolution.

- Full unit test coverage

Missing in this release
