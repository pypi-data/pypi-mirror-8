=== Incomplete awlsim TODO list ===

S7 compatibility:
- Add support for STRUCTs (This requires the removal of awlsim's newline-implies-semicolon semantics in headers)
- Add support for user defined data types (UDT)
- Implement parsing of attributes
- Implement POINTER and DB-pointer immediates
- Implement ANY pointer
- Add support for multiinstance calls

GUI:
- Make font size configurable (and save it in project file)
- Save window status (open MDI windows, positions, etc) in project file
- Auto-indent in editor
