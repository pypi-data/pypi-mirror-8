        pysubs2 is a Python library for editing subtitle files.
        Itâ€™s based on *SubStation Alpha*, the native format of
        `Aegisub <http://www.aegisub.org/>`_; it also supports *SubRip* and
        *MicroDVD* formats. There is a small CLI tool for batch conversion
        and retiming.
