RAX-AUTOSCALER


Uses the rackspace APIs to allow for scaling based on aggregate metrics
across a cluster.
Can be used and installed on the auto-scale group members or on a
dedicated management instance.

[Stories in Ready]


Installation

    pip install RAX-AutoScaler

Configuration

Edit config.json adding the following:

-   API username
-   API key
-   Region name
-   Autoscaling group section should contain:
-   AutoScale Group UUID
-   Scale Up Policy UUID
-   Scale Down Policy UUID
-   Check Type (agent.cpu, agent.load_average...)
-   Metric Name (depends on the check type)
-   Scale Up Threshold
-   Scale Down Threshold
-   Webhooks Url (Pre & Post commit url(s) for scale up/down)


Usage

Once configured you can invoke the autoscaler.py script with the
following required argument --as-group:

-   --as-group must refer to a section in the config.json file

You can also invoke the script with the --cluster option this should be
used when this script actually runs on auto-scale group members.
Otherwise if it is running on a dedicated management instance you do not
require this option.

Once tested you should configure this script to run as a cron job either
on a management instance or on all cluster members

Note

RAX-AutoScaler depends on Rackspace Monitoring Agent to get the data
from nodes in scaling group.
If the agent is not installed please read: Install the Cloud Monitoring
Agent
