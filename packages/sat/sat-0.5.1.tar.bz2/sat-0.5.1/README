** ABOUT **

SàT is a XMPP (Jabber) client, made on a daemon/frontends architecture. Its aim is not only to be an instant messaging client: SàT manage microblogging, file transfer, rich text edition, piping over XMPP, XMPP remote, etc.
In addition, SàT has been built with ethic in mind, a social contract show the main lines (see CONTRAT_SOCIAL or CONTRAT_SOCIAL_en). We have a lot of debates about the right way to do things, more on a social way than on a technical way (but consider technique too).

For the moment, the frontends are:

* wix: based on WxWidgets, a minimal and old fashioned desktop frontend
* primitivus: a console interface client, for screen lovers
* jp: the powerful command line toolkit.
* libervia: the web frontend. It's in a different package, check libervia on the wiki: http://wiki.goffi.org/wiki/Libervia
* bellaciao: a Qt frontend at an early development stage

other frontends planed in the near future:

* mobile frontends, fuse frontend, etc.


** HOW TO USE IT ? **

For installation instructions, please read the file "INSTALL". Note that SàT is available in several GNU/Linux distributions

A wiki is available online (http://wiki.goffi.org), in French and English so far (we would appreciate any help for other languages). You can also have a look at the bottom of this files (in contact section) for other available websites.


** MISC **

To use SàT, you need to have D-Bus daemon launched (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/). If you use X Window, it should already be launched. If your are on a terminal environment without X11 (e.g. on a server) you may have to launch it. You can launch a daemon using the following command:
$ eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax`

Be careful to use the same environment variables if you start a new session.

I personally use the following script to do that automatically:

--- /usr/local/bin/dbus-launch.sh ---
#!/bin/sh

DBUS_PATH="/tmp/.dbus.`whoami`"

if [ ! -e $DBUS_PATH ]; then
        dbus-launch --sh-syntax > $DBUS_PATH
        chmod 400 $DBUS_PATH
fi

cat $DBUS_PATH
--- end of /usr/local/bin/dbus-launch.sh ---

You can launch this script by putting at the end of your .zshrc (or whatever you're using):
eval `/usr/local/bin/dbus-launch.sh`

--

You can find Primitivus shortcuts on the wiki:
http://wiki.goffi.org/wiki/Primitivus

--

SàT is the acronym (yes another one :( ) in tribute to the song Salut à Toi from the Bérurier Noir band. I recommend also the excellent cover from Les Ogres de Barback.
jp stands for "Jabber coPy" or "JumP".
Primitivus is based on Urwid, and, according to their FAQ, "ur" is a German prefix for "ancestral or primal" (primitivus is a latin word).
wix come of course from the WX of wxwidgets and just sounds cool :).


** /!\ PRIVACY WARNING /!\ **

To make setup easier, SàT asks a website (http://www.goffi.org) the external ip address of client. So a request is made to this page: http://www.goffi.org/sat_tools/get_ip.php .
The IP will appear in the private Apache logs (in the same way as IP used to download the software), which are automatically saved, but will not be used. Future releases will probably come with a warning about this and an easy way to avoid it.


** CREDIT **

A big big thank to the authors/contributors of...

proxy65:
SàT (plugin_xep_0065) use nearly all the code from proxy65 (http://code.google.com/p/proxy65/) which was coded by Dave Smith (2002-2004) and maintained by Fabio Forno (2007-2008).
As the original MIT licence allows, the code is reused and sub-licenced until GPL v3 to follow the rest of the code.

progressbar:
SàT (jp) use ProgressBar (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/2.2), a class coded by Nilton Volpato which allow the textual representation of progression.

twisted:
SàT is heavily based on the twisted framework (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/), a very great tool which offer a lot of protocols management. There are too many contributors to name them here, so take a look on the website :).

wokkel:
SàT use a library with high level enhancements on top of twisted, which is called wokkel (http://wokkel.ik.nu). Lot of thanks to Ralph Meijer and all other contributors.

wxWidgets & wxPython:
The Wix frontend is made with wxWidgets (www.wxwidgets.org) and its python version wxPython (wxPython), which is a really handy UI toolkit who works on most popular platforms. It can be found on probably all major Gnu/Linux distributions.

Urwid:
Primitivus is based on Urwid (http://excess.org/urwid/) which saved me a lot of time. It's really a great library to easily make a sophisticated interface.

Pyjamas:
Libervia is built with a Pyjamas (http://pyjs.org), a Google Web Toolkit port for python, including Python to Javascript compiler, and Pyjamas Desktop which allow to execute the same application on the desktop or through a browser. It's really an amazing tool.

Pyfeed and Xe:
SàT core and Libervia use pyfeed and xe (http://home.avvanta.com/%7Esteveha/pyfeed.html), 2 libraries made Steve R. Hastings really useful to parse/generate xml stuff as atom feeds.

txJSON-RPC:
Libervia use txJSON-RPC (https://launchpad.net/txjsonrpc), a twisted library to communicate with the browser's javascript throught JSON-RPC

Mutagen:
Mutagen (https://code.google.com/p/mutagen/) is an audio metadata handling library, it's use by the radiocol plugin.

otr.js and its dependencies Big Integer Library, CryptoJS, EventEmitter:
Libervia frontend uses otr.js and its dependencies:
    - otr.js was coded by Arlo Breault (2014) and is released under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0
    - Big Integer Library was coded by Leemon Baird (2000-2013) and is in the public domain
    - CryptoJS was coded by Jeff Mott (2009-2013) and is released under the MIT licence
    - EventEmitter was coded by Oliver Caldwell (2011-2013) and is released under the MIT licence
As the original licences allow, the code is reused and sub-licenced until GPL v3 to follow the rest of the code.

pictures found in the sat_media repository and used by SàT and Libervia:
Please read the credits and licence information that are given in the README and COPYING files for each work: http://repos.goffi.org/sat_media/file

the powerfull ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/) is used by the script written to split the previously named picture.

and the others:
and of course, nothing would be possible without Python (http://www.python.org/), GNU and the Free Software Foundation (http://www.gnu.org, http://www.fsf.org/), the Linux Kernel (http://www.kernel.org/), and the coder of the tools I use like Vim (http://www.vim.org/), Mercurial (http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/), or all the KDE stuff (http://www.kde.org/ and of course http://amarok.kde.org/), and also XFCE (http://www.xfce.org), etc. Thanks thanks thanks, thanks to everybody in the Free (Libre) chain for making a part of the dream.

If I forgot any credit (and I probably have), please contact me (mail below) to fix it.
