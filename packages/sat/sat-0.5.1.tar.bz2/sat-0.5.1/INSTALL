You can install SàT automatically using easy_install or pip, and it is available in several GNU/Linux distributions. The full instructions are available on the wiki: http://wiki.goffi.org/wiki/Salut_%C3%A0_Toi
Below is are installation instructions, but please check the wiki which may be more up-to-date.

***

You can automatically install SàT and its dependencies using easy_install or pip. You will however need to install Python's headers (needed to build some packages), WxPython which is available in most Gnu/Linux distributions, PyGObject and developments version of libxml2 and libxslt (to compile lxml python library).

NOTE: pyfeed and xe are mandatory dependencies, they should be on http://pypi.python.org (PYthon Package Index, the official repository for Python projects) and so being automatically installed; but they are not yet there (their author should do it soon), so you have to install them manually until then.
You can download them respectively on http://home.avvanta.com/%7Esteveha/pyfeed-0.7.4.tar.gz and http://home.avvanta.com/%7Esteveha/xe-0.7.4.tar.gz, then decompress them and do « python setup.py install » on both.
An other way is to use the (insecure) pip options --process-dependency-links and --allow-all-external when installing sat, options which will soon be (or already are) removed from pip.


The environment variable SAT_INSTALL customises the installation, it contains flags separated by spaces:
	- "nopreinstall" skips all preinstallation checks
	- "autodeb" automatically installs missing packages on Debian-based distributions
	- "nox" disables installation of X-based packages (WxWidgets), this is useful for servers

WxPython and PyGobject are automatically installed on Debian-based distributions if "autodeb" option is set. Indeed, on Debian-based distribution, you can type (with the root account):

# apt-get install python-pip python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
# SAT_INSTALL=autodeb pip install .

On a *buntu, same commands with sudo:

$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
$ sudo SAT_INSTALL=autodeb pip install .


After installing SàT, you need to install the media:

$ mkdir -p ~/sat/media/destination/path
$ cd ~/sat/media/destination/path
wget ftp://ftp.goffi.org/sat_media/sat_media.tar.bz2
tar -jxvf sat_media.tar.bz2

then, create a ~/.sat.conf file which contains:

### sat.conf ###
[DEFAULT]
media_dir=~/sat/media/destination/path
### end sat.conf ###

Of course, replace ~/sat/media/destination/path with the actual path you want to use.

You should now be able to launch sat:
	- to launch the backend, enter
$ sat
	- to stop the backend, enter:
$ sat stop
	- to launch Primitivus, enter:
$ primitivus
	then create a profile.
	- to launch Wix, enter
$ wix
	then create a profile.
	- to use jp, follow its help:
$ jp --help
