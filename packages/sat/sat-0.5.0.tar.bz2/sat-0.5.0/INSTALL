You can install SàT automatically using easy_install or pip, and it is available in several GNU/Linux distributions. The full instructions are available on the wiki: http://wiki.goffi.org/wiki/Salut_%C3%A0_Toi
Below is are installation instructions, but check wiki which may be more up-to-date

***

You can automatically install SàT and his dependencies using easy_install or pip. You will however need to install Python's headers (needed to build some packages), WxPython which is available in most Gnu/Linux distributions, PyGObject and developments version of libxml2 and libxslt (to compile lxml python library).

NOTE: pyfeed are xe are mandatory dependencies, they should be on http://pypi.python.org (PYthon Package Index, the officiel repository for Python projects) and so being automatically installed; but there are not yet there (their author should do it soon), so you have to install them manually until then.
You can download them respectively on http://www.blarg.net/%7Esteveha/pyfeed-0.7.4.tar.gz and http://www.blarg.net/%7Esteveha/xe-0.7.4.tar.gz, then decompress them and do « python setup.py install » on both.
An other way is to use the (unsecure) pip options --process-dependency-links and --allow-all-external when installing sat, options which are or will be removed soon from pip.


The environment variable SAT_INSTALL customise the installation, it contains flags separated by spaces:
	- "nopreinstall" skip all preinstallation checks
	- "autodeb" automatically install missing packages on Debian based distributions
	- "nox" disable installation of X based packages (WxWidgets), this is useful for servers

WxPython and PyGobject are automatically installed on Debian based distributions if "autodeb" option is set. Indeed, on Debian based distribution, you can type (with the root account):

# apt-get install python-pip python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
# SAT_INSTALL=autodeb pip install .

On a *buntu, same commands with sudo:

$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
$ sudo SAT_INSTALL=autodeb pip install .


After installing SàT, you need to install the media:

$ mkdir -p ~/sat/media/destination/path
$ cd ~/sat/media/destination/path
wget ftp://ftp.goffi.org/sat_media/sat_media.tar.bz2
tar -jxvf sat_media.tar.bz2

then, create a ~/.sat.conf file which contains:

### sat.conf ###
[DEFAULT]
media_dir=~/sat/media/destination/path
### end sat.conf ###

Of course, replace ~/sat/media/destination/path with the actual path you want to use.

You should now be able to launch sat:
	- to launch the backend, enter
$ sat
	- to stop the backend, enter:
$ sat stop
	- to launch Primitivus, enter:
$ primitivus
	then create a profile.
	- to launch Wix, enter
$ wix
	then create a profile.
	- to use jp, follow its help:
$ jp --help
