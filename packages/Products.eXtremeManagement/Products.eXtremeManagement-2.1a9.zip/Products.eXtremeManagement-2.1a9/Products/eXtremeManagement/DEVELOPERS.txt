Release Management
==================

Products.eXtremeManagement currently requires a number of additional packages:

- xm.booking
- xm.portlets
- xm.charting
- kss.plugin.yuidnd
- kss.plugin.cns
- Products.contentmigration
- Products.Poi
- pygooglechart

We manage these packages with the install_requires option in the setup.py.
As a result users of xm only have to place Products.eXtremeManagement in
their buildout.cfg. The setuptools will do the rest by installing the correct
packages.

For each release of Products.eXtremeManagement the version range which is
valid for that release will be added to the install_requires argument.

Example of trunk::

      install_requires=[
          'setuptools',
          # -*- Extra requirements: -*-
          'xm.booking',
          'xm.portlets',
          'xm.charting',
          'kss.plugin.yuidnd',
          'kss.plugin.cns',
          'Products.contentmigration >= 1.0b4',
          'Products.Poi',
          'pygooglechart',
      ], 

On the trunk we always work with the latest version of both package, so we
don't specify any versions here..

Example of the 1.6 tag::

      install_requires=[
          'setuptools',
          # -*- Extra requirements: -*-
          'xm.booking >= 0.5, <= 0.6dev',
          'xm.portlets >= 0.5, <= 0.6dev',
          ...
      ], 

On this tag we set the minimum version to 0.5 and the maximum to 0.6dev.
Installing this egg will pick up support releases like 0.5.1 but will
ignore newer versions. 0.6 and higher.
