Description: Products.flickrgallery
        ========================
        A photogallery product which loads images from flickr
        It includes a portlet which can be used to filter galleries by 
        keyword.
        
        Warning this is an old product for Plone which has been made
        compatible with Plone 4.3.x. It doesn't have a test suite yet so 
        I make zero guarantees.
        
        Your mileage will vary, releasing it in case it's useful to others.
