Products.flickrgallery
========================
A photogallery product which loads images from flickr
It includes a portlet which can be used to filter galleries by 
keyword.

Warning this is an old product for Plone which has been made
compatible with Plone 4.3.x. It doesn't have a test suite yet so 
I make zero guarantees.

Your mileage will vary, releasing it in case it's useful to others.
