#       The Tx class allows publish and ack operations to be batched into atomic
#       units of work.  The intention is that all publish and ack requests issued
#       within a transaction will complete successfully or none of them will.
#       Servers SHOULD implement atomic transactions at least where all publish
#       or ack requests affect a single queue.  Transactions that cover multiple
#       queues may be non-atomic, given that queues can be created and destroyed
#       asynchronously, and such events do not form part of any transaction.
#       Further, the behaviour of transactions with respect to the immediate and
#       mandatory flags on Basic.Publish methods is not defined.

#                           / C:ROLLBACK S:ROLLBACK-OK
