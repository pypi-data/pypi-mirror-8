pysndfile requires availability of libsndfile [http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/). 
 
If the libsndfile (header and library) is not installed in the default compiler search path you have to 
specify the library and include directories to be added to this search paths. For this you can use either the
command line options --sndfile-libdir and --sndfile-incdir that are available for the build_ext command
or specify these two parameters in the setup.cfg file.

Besides the setup is pretty standard. Note, that the cython source _pysndfile.pyx will be compiled with cython only if cython is installed.
