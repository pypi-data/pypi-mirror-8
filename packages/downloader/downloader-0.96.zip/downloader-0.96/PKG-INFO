Description: 
        		Each Downloader maintains an sqlite3-based disk cache that utilizes zlib
        		compression. Network requests are only made if the cached version of the
        		resource has an age larger or equal to the stale_after value provided by the
        		programmer.
        
        		Between network requests a throttling interval needs to elapse. This throttling
        		interval is randomly chosen, but lies within the throttle_bounds defined by the
        		programmer.
        
        		HTML resources can be parsed using lxml and in this case an lxml ElementTree is
        		returned instead of a file object, with the links rewritten to be absolute in
        		order to facilitate following them. The parsing is done leniently in order to
        		not fail when invalid HTML is encountered.
        
        		The programmer can also supply a function that decides whether the server has
        		banned the client (possibly by examining the returned resource). In this case
        		an exception will be raised.
        
        		Downloader's features make it ideal for writing scrapers, as it can keep its
        		network footprint small (due to the cache) and irregular (due to the random
        		throttling interval).
