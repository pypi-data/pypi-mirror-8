For more details and documentation on installing and using 
pyzor please visit http://www.pyzor.org/

Pyzor requires at least Python 2.6

To install this distribution, simply run the following:
	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install

Pyzor also works with Python3.3. The code will be automatically refactored with
2to3 during the setup:
	python3.3 setup.py install

Note that the MySQLdb library does not currently support Python3.
