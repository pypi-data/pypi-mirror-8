Description: # GoPro
        
        ### A complete Python GoPro module made easy.
        
        At the moment this module only works with the newest GoPro Hero 4.
        
        The earlier versions of GoPro are not backwards/forwards compatible.
        
        ## Install
        
        Easy install with Github or PyPi
        
        Installing the **latest version from GitHub**.
        
        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/DenisCarriere/gopro.git
        $ cd gopro
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Installing the **tested version from PyPi**.
        
        ```bash
        $ sudo pip install gopro
        ```
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        Once the installation is complete you are ready to start! :)
        
        The default `IP` address for the GoPro is using `10.5.5.9`.
        
        You must first be connected to the GoProApp Wifi connection.
        
        Launch your favorite `ipython` or standard `python`
        
        ```python
        >>> import gopro
        >>> camera = gopro.camera()
        >>> camera.status
        {'connection': 'OK',
         'datetime': '2014-11-12T23:53:59',
         'ip': '10.5.5.9',
         'ok': True,
         'screen': 'video',
         'storage': '31.3 GB',
         'time_offset': 'now'}
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Take a Photo or Video
        
        With very simple commands you can tell your GoPro to start recording or take a photo.
        
        The screen will automaticly change to the approriate page.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.photo()
        >>> camera.video()
        >>> camera.timelapse()
        ```
        
        ## Camera modes
        
        Makes it easy to cycle threw each available modes.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.mode('burst')
        >>> camera.mode('photo')
        >>> camera.mode('timelapse')
        >>> camera.mode('video')
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Locate (Beep! Beep!)
        
        Can't find your device?? Call the locate function and it will Beep endlessly until there is no more battery.
        
        To turn off the beeps, simply press the `mode` button on the device or use the `off` as a parameter.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.locate('on')
        >>> camera.locate('off')
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Sleep
        
        The camera will turn itself off, the Wi-Fi will still be active.
        
        At the moment there is no working commands to turn the device back on.
        
        To reactivate the device, press the `mode` button.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.sleep()
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Delete Photos
        
        Might be useful to dump all those photos from your GoPro.
        
        **Warning** once you delete photos/videos you cannot retrieve them back.
        
        The `erase` function does the same as the delete all.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.erase()
        >>> camera.delete_all()
        >>> camera.delete_last()
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Settings
        
        You can explore the different types of settings & status by getting the raw JSON response or selecting a specific pre-parsed attribute
        
        ### Processed attributes
        
        **Status - Screen**
        
        This will let you know which page your GP is currently active.
        
        There are only 4 available outcomes.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.status
        'settings'
        'video'
        'photo'
        'timelapse'
        ...
        ```
        
        ### Raw JSON Responses
        
        The original response from the GoPro device.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.settings_raw
        >>> camera.status_raw
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Date & Time
        
        It is a good idea to sync your GoPro with the same clock as your computer.
        
        An easy way to do this is use the `datetime` &  `time_offset` attribute.
        
        Try to aim your GoPro to have less than 1 second offset.
        
        The `time_offset` is measured in (+/-) seconds.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.datetime
        2014-11-12 21:53:09
        >>> camera.datetime_offset
        -0.320142
        ...
        ```
        
        ## File Storage
        
        Here is how you can retrieve the total file storage in (KB) or pretty human readeable format.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.status_storage
        31330144
        >>> camera.status['storage']
        '31.3 GB'
        ```
        
        ## Debug
        
        Want to explore & troubleshoot the device a bit, you can retrieve the following properties from your device.
        
        ```python
        >>> camera.debug
        >>> camera.info
        >>> camera.commands
        ...
        ```
