OVERVIEW

DPAPIck is a python toolkit to provide a platform-independant implementation
of Microsoft's cryptography subsytem called DPAPI (Data Protection API).

It can be used either as a library or as a standalone tool.

It is also the first open-source tool that allows decryption of DPAPI
structures in an offline way and, moreover, from another plateform than
Windows.

It is provided with some application probes that includes the built-in logic
to retreive the corresponding secrets that are protected.

REQUIREMENTS

This application has been developped and tested on python 2.7.

M2Crypto is required to provide all the requireds algorithms. To obtain it,
see: http://chandlerproject.org/bin/view/Projects/MeTooCrypto

Probes and other tool may require other modules to be able to retreive
information such as:
  * python-sqlite3 for Google Chrome password database
  * CFPropertyList for Apple Safari keychain.plist
      see https://github.com/bencochran/CFPropertyList
  * python-registry for low-level manipulation of hives
      see https://github.com/williballenthin/python-registry
  * pyASN1 for the RSA key pair manipulation
      see http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net/

We also recommend the use of MoonSols Windows Memory Toolkit to convert
hibernation file to usable memory dumps and be able to extract credentials
from it.
