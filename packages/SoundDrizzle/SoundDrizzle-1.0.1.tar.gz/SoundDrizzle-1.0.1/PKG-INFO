Description: # SoundDrizzle
        
        This is nothing more than a simple downloader for SoundCloud so that you can listen to your favorite tracks offline.
        
        **It is your responsibility to check whether or not the track has rights reserved, and if you're allowed to download**
        
        You can use the script against SoundCloud URLs...
        
        ```bash
        $ drizzle https://soundcloud.com/wearecc/dublabs-cc10-mix
        ```
        
        or perform a search on the API:
        
        ```bash
        $ drizzle "dublabs #cc10"
        ```
