        by clicking on one of the plus signs available in the slots calendar
        as shown below:

        Each booking element once created is storerd into its own **Booking Folder**.
        
        
        Booking Folder content
        ----------------------
        
        **Booking Folder** is a folderish content type which store your **Booking** objects.

          :target: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/rg.prenotazioni/booking-folder-form.png
        
        
        Since version **2.1** new functionalities has been added to the folder
        configuration:
        
        - more then one gate can be handled
        - booking vacations supports also bookings with no gate assigned
        
        Since version **3.0** the agenda has:
        - a new user interface
        - allows custom duration for booking types
        
        Creating a new booking content

        Anonymous and authenticated users are allowed to add new booking content
        by clicking on the plus signs on the default booking folder view.

          :target: http://blog.redturtle.it/pypi-images/rg.prenotazioni/default-view.png
        
        After its creation the slot will be displayed as "busy" for anonymous user
        and the slot won't be available anymore.
        
        Back-end users can see and manage the reservation according
        to the assigned Plone roles.

        Since version **2.1**:
        - captcha has been added for anonymous users.
        - booking content can be added only from the view folder links.
        - booking can't be added in the past anymore.
        
        Backend view
        ------------
        
        The backend view is quite different from the anonimous user view.

        Workflow
        --------
        
        The product comes with its own workflow "prenotazioni_workflow".
        
        Since versione **2.1** a new states has been added.
        Here below a list of all the states available:
        
        **Private**: booking object initial state:
        
        * `submit` (Automatic transition to pending)
        
        **Pending**
        
        Transaction available:
        
        * `publish` (to published)
        * `refuse` (to refused)
        
        **Published**
        
        Transaction available:
        
        * `refuse` (to refused)
        
        **Refused**
        
        Transaction available:
        
        * `restore` (to pending)
        
        Managers can confirm a Booking using workflow transitions.
        The workflow transition triggers an email to be sent to the booker (see below).
        
        
        Content Rules (mail notifications)
        ----------------------------------
        
        There are additional content rules that can be used to notify booking owner when his booking has been accepted
        or re-scheduled.
        
        Rules **are not automatically** as of version **3.x**. They are imported by a separate generic setup profile.
        
        There's also a rule that can warn the Booking Folder responsible when new booking are created, but you need to
        manually enable it on folders.
        
        
        Vacations
        ---------
        
        You can specify days when the Booking Folder will not accept
        bookings.
        Those days are called "Vacation days".
        Vacation days can be specified compiling the "Vacation days"
        field in the Booking Folder edit form.
        Values are allowed in the format DD/MM/YYYY.
        Instead of the year you can put an asterisk, in this case every here
        the day DD of month MM will be considered a vacation day.
        
        It is also possible to specify a vacation period
        for a single gate using the vacation booking form.

        Searching
        ---------
        
        Using the prenotazioni_search view it is possible to search
        bookings within a given time interval.
        You can also filter the results specifying a searchable text,
        a gate or a review state.
