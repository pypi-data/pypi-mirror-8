Description: ======================
         dataflake.docbuilder
        ======================
        
        This package provides a set of scripts to automate building
        Sphinx-based package documentation for packages hosted on a 
        source code revision control server such as Subversion, 
        Git or Mercurial. They will...
        
        - check out the current development trunk and all tagged versions
        
        - build all Sphinx-based documentation in them, if it exists
        
        - stitch together the trunk and release versions in a single 
          HTML file to provide a simple jump-off page for all package 
          versions
        
        - rebuild the Sphinx documentation if there were any changes 
          since the last build

        Change log
        ==========
        
        1.15 (2014-11-21)
        -----------------
        - switched documentation to point to the new Git repository
        - use new bootstrap.py script
        
        
        1.14 (2011-11-29)
        -----------------
        - Add a flag ``-m``/``--max-tags`` to set the number of package
          versions (tags) to be shown on the generated main page. If more
          tags exist, a link to a separate page is provided that shows all
          versions.
        
        
        1.13 (2011-10-31)
        -----------------
        - Catch additional errors upon building
        - Ignoring empty tag lists when asking Git for tags
        
        
        1.12 (2011-08-30)
        -----------------
        - Be more resilient when simple ReST text compilation or 
          Sphinx building fails. Now the whole documentation build 
          process won't just fail at that point.
        - provide more meaningful log messages when running with 
          the ``-v`` option.
        
        
        1.11 (2011-08-09)
        -----------------
        - Now you can use ``Git`` alongside ``Mercurial`` and 
          ``Subversion`` to use as version control system.
        
        
        1.10 (2011-08-09)
        -----------------
        - Taking more control of logging by defining our own logger and
          suppressing standard Sphinx log output. The new script flag 
          ``-v`` or ``--verbose`` enables the user to determine what to 
          show. Without it, only serious warnings are shown. With ``-v``
          specified once you will see script progress output and notes 
          about Sphinx build warnings. With ``-vv`` all Sphinx output 
          is shown as well.
        
        
        1.9 (2011-08-09)
        ----------------
        - Now using pkg_resources.parse_version to parse the tag names and 
          produce correct release ordering for each package
        - Instead of using a flag to set the revision control system 
          across all packages you now specify the revision control system 
          per package with a simple prefix::
        
            [hg]http://myserver/hg/mypackage
            [svn]https://myservr/svnmypackage
        
          For backwards compatibility, all URLs without prefix are assumed 
          to point to a Subversion repository.
        
        
        1.8 (2011-08-05)
        ----------------
        - Feature: You can now use either ``Subversion`` or ``Mercurial``
          to check out documented packages.
        
        
        1.7 (2010-08-03)
        ----------------
        - Feature: If no standard package documentation can be found, 
          the setuptools ``long_description`` settings is used as a 
          last fallback to at least generate a single page for a package.
        
        - Feature: To style the ``long_description`` fallback ReST 
          documentation, a new parameter ``fallback-css`` can be used to 
          provide a path to a CSS file.
        
        
        1.6 (2010-07-31)
        ----------------
        - Bug: If the ``z3csphinx-output-directory`` was set, all its 
          contained packages ended up on the index document. Now this 
          only happens if no SVN source URLs are otherwise provided.
          If they are, only packages from those source URLs are 
          considered for linking on the index document.
        
        
        1.5 (2010-07-31)
        ----------------
        - Feature: If you generate some documentation via 
          `z3c.recipe.sphinxdoc` and want to stitch links to it 
          into the generated index file, you can use the new 
          ``z3csphinx-output-directory`` parameter to point the script 
          to the generated package documentation root folder.
        
        
        1.4 (2010-07-31)
        ----------------
        - Bug: Don't clean up intermediate files, otherwise it is not 
          possible to re-use a template folder for creating several
          separate pages into an output folder.
        
        - Bug: Clean up group header creation to avoid header level
          mixups.
        
        - Bug: When creating a missing required index.rst, use a 
          template file if it exists.
        
        
        1.3 (2010-07-30)
        ----------------
        - Feature: Added a script and buildout option ``index-name`` to 
          specify the file name (without extension) for the index page.
          With this option you can safely build the index page into an 
          existing `Sphinx` documentation folder without overwriting 
          or changing the existing ``index.rst`` file and its HTML 
          equivalent. The default continues to be ``index.rst``, though.
        
        - Feature removed: It is no longer possible to create a simple HTML
          index page without using `Sphinx` and a minimal `Sphinx` 
          configuration.
        
        
        1.2 (2010-07-29)
        ----------------
        - Feature: Add new script option ``-g``/``--grouping`` and zc.buildout 
          option ``grouping`` to group packages.
        
        - Miscellaneous: Renamed the zc.buildout option `source` to `sources`
          since it contains one or more elements.
        
        - Miscellaneous: Removed the version pinning on the Sphinx dependency 
          since our other dependency (repoze.sphinx.autointerface) is now 
          compatible with Sphinx 1.0.
        
        - Bug: If pkg_resources.find_distributions cannot find valid
          Egg distributions we still force the tag folder itself into the 
          pkg_resources.working_set as a fallback.
        
        
        1.1 (2010-07-25)
        ----------------
        - Feature: The user can now provide a Sphinx configuration folder 
          path that will be used to generate additional content for the 
          documentation root folder.
        
        - Factoring: Moved the DocsBuilder class into its own module.
        
        - Factoring: Save run state on the documentation builder class 
          instead of handing it around
        
        - Cosmetic: Use a flat hierarchy when creating the HTML output links
          instead of a folder per package. Only a single index page needs to 
          be created that way.
        
        
        1.0 (2010-07-23)
        ----------------
        - Initial release
