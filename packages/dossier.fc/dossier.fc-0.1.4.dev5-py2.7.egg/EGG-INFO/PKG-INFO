Description: `dossier.fc` is a Python package that provides an implementation of feature 
        collections. Abstractly, a feature collection is a map from feature name to 
        a feature. While any type of feature can be supported, the core focus of this 
        package is on *multisets* or "bags of words" (BOW). In this package, the 
        default multiset implementation is a `StringCounter`, which maps Unicode 
        strings to counts.
        
        This package also includes utilities for serializing and deserializating 
        collections of feature collections to CBOR (Concise Binary Object 
        Representation).
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        `dossier.fc` is on PyPI and can be installed with `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install dossier.fc
        ```
        
        Currently, `dossier.fc` requires Python 2.7. It is not yet Python 3 compatible.
        
        
        ### Documentation
        
        API documentation with examples is available as part of the Dossier Stack 
        documentation: http://diffeo.com/dossier-stack
        
        
        ### Examples and basic usage
        
        By default, feature collections use `StringCounter` for feature representation:
        
        ```python
        from dossier.fc import FeatureCollection
        
        fc = FeatureCollection()
        fc['NAME']['alice'] += 1
        fc['NAME']['bob'] = 5
        
        print type(fc['NAME'])
        # output: StringCounter
        ```
        
        As the name suggests, a `StringCounter` is a subclass of the `Counter` class 
        found in the Python standard library `collections` module. As such, it supports 
        binary operations like addition, subtraction, equality testing, etc. 
        The `FeatureCollection` class also provides these binary operations which are 
        performed on corresponding features. For example:
        
        ```python
        from dossier.fc import FeatureCollection
        
        fc1 = FeatureCollection({'NAME': {'alice': 1, 'bob': 1}})
        fc2 = FeatureCollection({'NAME': {'alice': 1}})
        fc3 = fc1 + fc2
        
        assert fc3 == FeatureCollection({'NAME': {'alice': 2, 'bob': 1}})
        ```
