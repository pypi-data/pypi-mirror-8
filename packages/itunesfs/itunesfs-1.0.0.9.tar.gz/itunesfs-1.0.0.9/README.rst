itunes\_file\_system (itunesfs)
===============================

**Script for generating an iTunes Connect package (.itmsp) straight from
your asset folder**

***itunesfs*** performs the following conversion:

The task of managing and uploading the localised assets of your iOS app
in a tedious one. When the number of supported languages increases, the
effort needed via the web interface of `iTunes
Connect <https://itunesconnect.apple.com>`__ is increased accordingly.
Apple's **iTMSTransporter** tool gives you the ability to download and
upload App Store Packages (.itmsp) from the command line. However,
altering the data requires an XML file manipulation.

An easier way is to use `**itunes\_transporter\_generator
(itmsp)** <https://github.com/colinhumber/itunes_transporter_generator>`__
, which lets you add your metadata in a **YAML** app configuration.
Running *itmsp* converts the YAML file to an **.itmsp package** that can
be uploaded using iTMSTransporter. However, when multiple localized
assets are involved, this solution leads to editing a huge unmanageable
YAML file.

This tool, **itunes\_file\_system (itunesfs)**, lets you organise your
assets (screenshots, description, keywords etc) in a specific file
hierarchy. Running *itunesfs* produces an intermediate YAML
configuration file and, if you have *itmsp* installed, it uses it to
generate the final .itmsp package. You can then uploaded it on iTunes
Connect using iTMSTransporter.

Installation
------------

1. Download and install `**python
   3** <http://www.python.org/download/>`__. Python 2.x is not supported
   at the moment.
2. If you have **PIP**
   `installed <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`__
   for Python 3 type:

   ::

       $ pip3 install itunesfs  

   Otherwise download the source from
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/itunesfs/ and type:

   ::

       $ sudo python3 setup.py install  

3. *(optional)* Install
   `itunes\_transporter\_generator <https://github.com/colinhumber/itunes_transporter_generator>`__
   running:

   ::

       $ gem install itunes_transporter_generator

*Note that you will need apple's iTMSTransporter, to upload the package
at iTunes. If you have Xcode installed, you already have this tool on
your system.*

Usage
-----

Organise your folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your files have to be under a root folder and organised as shown in the
"example" app, which is included in the package. Note that all files
should be encoded using **UTF-8**.

.\ |file hierarchy|

-  At the root folder, the **config\_app.yaml** contains the basic
   configuration for the app.
-  One or more **versions** can exist as folders under the root folder.
-  Each version can have one or more **locales**. The "master" locale,
   that should always be available, is "en-US".
-  Each locale can have:

   -  the **config-local.yaml**, that contains locale related
      configuration such as the title of the app
   -  the **description.txt**, that holds the App Store description
   -  the **keywords.txt**, that is a comma separated list of the
      keywords. The spaces around each keyword, will be erased. Also a
      warning will be produced when they exceed the App Store 100
      character limit.
   -  a **screenshot** folder. It can contain ipad, iphone\_3.5in,
      iphone\_4in, iphone\_4.7in or iphone\_5.5in subfolders. Each
      device subfolder can have one or more screenshot files. The order
      that they will be used is alphabetical.

The "en-US" locale must always contain the following files:
**config-local.yaml**, **description.txt**, **keywords.txt**. Even
though screenshots are optional, itmsp will fail to produce the .itmsp
without them.

For the other locales, these files are **optional**. If a file is not
found, the corresponding "en-US" file will be used instead.

Generate the .itmsp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your Python 3's bin folder is in yout PATH, then **itunesfs** can be
executed from the command line.

To generate the .itmsp package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have installed *itmsp*, *itunesfs* will call it by default to
generate the package from the YAML file.:

::

        $ itunesfs <path_to_asset_folder>

To generate *only* the intermediate YAML configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

        $ itunesfs <path_to_asset_folder> -t YAML
        

e.g. ``$itunesfs /example -t YAML``: this parses the "example" directory
and generates an *output.yaml* file under it.

If you want to change the output directory use:

::

        $ itunesfs <path_to_asset_folder> -o <output_path> -t YAML

This will also copy the screenshot files.

Verifying and uploading the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a really small guide for Apple's iTMSTransporter.

For ease of use, add this alias to your bash profile.

-  run: ``$open ~/.bash_profile``
-  add this line and save:
   ``alias iTMSTransporter='`xcode-select --print-path`/../Applications/Application\ Loader.app/Contents/MacOS/itms/bin/iTMSTransporter'``

Using iTMSTransporter:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remember to escape with "" special characters like "$" in the password
field. Also the path can be either the path for one package or the path
for a folder containing one or more packages.

To verify the package:

::

    $ iTMSTransporter -m verify  -u <username> -p <password>  -f <path_for_package>

To uplaod the package:

::

    $ iTMSTransporter -m upload  -u <username> -p <password>  -f <path_for_package>
