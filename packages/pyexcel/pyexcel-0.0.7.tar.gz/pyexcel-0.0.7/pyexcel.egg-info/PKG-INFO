        **pyexcel** is a wrapper library to read, manipulate and write data in different excel formats: csv, ods, xls, xlsx and xlsm. Its mission is to let you focus on data itself and it deals with different file formats. ODS format support is provided by `pyexcel-ods <https://github.com/chfw/pyexcel-ods>`__ or `pyexcel-ods3 <https://github.com/chfw/pyexcel-ods3>`__. Fonts, colors and charts are not supported.
        
        It was created due to the lack of uniform programming interface to access data in different formats. A developer needs to use different methods of different libraries to read the same data in different excel formats, hence the resulting code is cluttered and unmaintainable.
        
        In addition, the library recognizes that Excel files are de-facto file format for information sharing in non-software centric organisations. Excel files are not only used for mathematical computation in financial institutions but also used for many othe purposes in an office work environment.
        
        All great work have done by odf, ezodf(2), xlrd and other individual developers. This library unites only the data access code.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
            >>> import pyexcel as pe
            >>> book = pe.load_book("your_file.xls")
            >>> book.to_dict()
            {"Sheet 1":[[1, 2, 3], ["4", "5", "6"]], "Sheet 2": [["a", "b", "c"], ["e", "f", "g"]], "Sheet 3":[[True, True, False]]}
            >>> # access first sheet's top left cell
            >>> print(book["Sheet 1"]["A1"])
            1
            >>> # alternative access to the same cell
            >>> print(book["Sheet 1"][0,0])
