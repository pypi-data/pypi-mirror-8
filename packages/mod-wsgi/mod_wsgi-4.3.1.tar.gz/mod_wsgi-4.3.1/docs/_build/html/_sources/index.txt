mod_wsgi
========

The mod_wsgi package implements a simple to use Apache module which can
host any Python application which supports the Python WSGI_ interface.

.. _WSGI: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/

Status
======

No mod_wsgi is not dead, it's just been resting.

Expect renewed development on mod_wsgi during 2014.

Completely revised documentation will progressively be incorporated here.
In the mean time keep referring to the older documentation at:

    http://www.modwsgi.org/

Due to security issues in versions of mod_wsgi up to and including
version 3.4, it is recommended that version 3.5 or later be used.

If you need help in using mod_wsgi, then use the mod_wsgi mailing list to
ask your questions:
