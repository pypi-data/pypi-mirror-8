Description: ``libparsing`` is a parsing element grammar (PEG) library written in C
        with Python bindings. It offers decent performance while allowing for a
        lot of flexibility. It is mainly intended to be used to create
        programming languages and software engineering tools.
        
        As opposed to more traditional parsing techniques, the grammar is not
        compiled but constructed using an API that allows dynamic update of the
        grammar.
        
        The parser does not do any tokeninzation, the instead input stream is
        consumed and parsing elements are dynamically asked to match the next
        element of it. Once parsing elements match, the resulting matched input
        is processed and an action is triggered.
        
        ``libparsing`` supports the following features:
        
        -  *backtracking*, ie. going back in the input stream if a match is not
           found
        -  *cherry-picking*, ie. skipping unrecognized input
        -  *contextual rules*, ie. a rule that will match or not depending on
           external variables
        
        Parsing elements are usually slower than compiled or FSM-based parsers
        as they trade performance for flexibility. It's probably not a great
        idea to use ``libparsing`` if the parsing has to happen as fast as
        possible (ie. a protocol implementation), but it is a great use for
        programming languages, as it opens up the door to dynamic syntax
        plug-ins and multiple language embedding.
        
        If you're interested in PEG, you can start reading Brian Ford's original
        article. Projects such as PEG/LEG by Ian Piumarta
        http://piumarta.com/software/peg/ ,OMeta by Alessandro Warth
        http://www.tinlizzie.org/ometa/ or Haskell's Parsec library
        https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec are of particular interest in
        the field.
        
        Here is a short example of what creating a simple grammar looks like in
        Python:
        
        ::
        
            g = Grammar()
            s = g.symbols
            g.token("WS",       "\s+")
            g.token("NUMBER",   "\d+(\.\d+)?")
            g.token("VARIABLE", "\w+")
            g.token("OPERATOR", "[\/\+\-\*]")
            g.group("Value",     s.NUMBER, s.VARIABLE)
            g.rule("Suffix",     s.OPERATOR._as("operator"), s.Value._as("value"))
            g.rule("Expression", s.Value, s.Suffix.zeroOrMore())
            g.axiom(s.Expression)
            g.skip(s.WS)
            match = g.parseString("10 + 20 / 5")
        
        and the equivalent code in C
        
        ::
        
            Grammar* g = Grammar_new()
            SYMBOL(WS,         TOKEN("\\s+"))
            SYMBOL(NUMBER,     TOKEN("\\d+(\\.\\d+)?"))
            SYMBOL(VARIABLE,   TOKEN("\\w+"))
            SYMBOL(OPERATOR,   GROUP("[\\/\\+\\-\\*]"))
            SYMBOL(Value,      GOUP(_S(NUMBER), _S(VARIABLE)))
            SYMBOL(Suffix,     RULE(_AS(_S(OPERATOR), "operator"), _AS(_S(Value), "value")))
            SYMBOL(Expression, RULE(_S(Value), _MO(Suffix))
            g->axiom = s_Expression;
            g->skip(s_WS);
            Grammar_prepare(g);
            Match* match = Grammar_parseString(g, "10 + 20 / 5")
