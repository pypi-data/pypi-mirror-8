        This is Yet Another Simple Configuration Parser module for INI style configurations files.
        
        parser.py [path to/name of an INI config file] [section.option to be fetched]
        
        The script takes two arguments
        
        The first argument is a name of configuration file  or full path to a
        configuration file (see below for "Configuration File" section for more details).
        The second argument may be "--list-all" to obtain a list of all available options
        or a key of specific option to get value for this option only (run first with
        "--list-all" to see what exactly can be used here).
        
        If an option doesn't belong to any of the sections in the configuration file
        then it should be addresses with \"default\" section, i.e:\n\
            default.[myoption]
        
        Configuration File
        If absolute path is provided to a configuration file then only that file is read but
        if only a name of configuration file is given then script will attempt to read
        a file by that name in following locations and order:
        - /etc/[config file name]
        - ~/[config file name]
        - directory from which the script has been ran.
        The configuration may contain sections in [section] format. Sample configuration file:
        
        [database]
        login = user
        password = topsecret
        host = example.com
        port = 3306
        
        [backend_api]
        login = api_user
        password = api_password
        url = http://example.com:9080
        
        
        Any options set in earlier configuration (like in /etc/) will be overridden
        should it also be specified in any following locations where the configuration
        file also was found. This way it allows to fine tune the configuration by placing
        general config in /etc and then user specific in his home dir followed by one it
        the script's run directory.
