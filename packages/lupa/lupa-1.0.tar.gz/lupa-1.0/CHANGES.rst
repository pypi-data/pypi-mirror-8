Lupa change log
===============

1.0 (2014-09-28)
----------------

* NOTE: this release includes the major backwards incompatible changes listed
  below.  It is believed that they simplify the interaction between Python code
  and Lua code by more strongly following idiomatic Lua on the Lua side.

  * Instead of passing a wrapped ``python.none`` object into Lua, ``None``
    return values are now mapped to ``nil``, making them more straight forward
    to handle in Lua code.  This makes the behaviour more consistent, as it
    was previously somewhat arbitrary where ``none`` could appear and where a
    ``nil`` value was used.  The only remaining exception is during iteration,
    where the first returned value must not be ``nil`` in Lua, or otherwise
    the loop terminates prematurely.  To prevent this, any ``None`` value
    that the iterator returns, or any first item in exploded tuples that is
    ``None``, is still mapped to ``python.none``. Any further values
    returned in the same iteration will be mapped to ``nil`` if they are
    ``None``, not to ``none``.  This means that only the first argument
    needs to be manually checked for this special case.  For the
    ``enumerate()`` iterator, the counter is never ``None`` and thus the
    following unpacked items will never be mapped to ``python.none``.

  * When ``unpack_returned_tuples=True``, iteration now also unpacks tuple
    values, including ``enumerate()`` iteration, which yields a flat sequence
    of counter and unpacked values.

  * When calling bound Python methods from Lua as "obj:meth()", Lupa now
    prevents Python from prepending the self argument a second time, so that
    the Python method is now called as "obj.meth()".  Previously, it was called
    as "obj.meth(obj)".  Note that this can be undesired when the object itself
    is explicitly passed as first argument from Lua, e.g. when calling
    "func(obj)" where "func" is "obj.meth", but these constellations should be
    rare.  As a work-around for this case, user code can wrap the bound method
    in another function so that the final call comes from Python.

* garbage collection works for reference cycles that span both runtimes,
  Python and Lua

* calling from Python into Lua and back into Python did not clean up the
  Lua call arguments before the innermost call, so that they could leak
  into the nested Python call or its return arguments

* support for Lua 5.2 (in addition to Lua 5.1 and LuaJIT 2.0)

* Lua tables support Python's "del" statement for item deletion
  (patch by Jason Fried)

* Attribute lookup can use a more fine-grained control mechanism by
  implementing explicit getter and setter functions for a LuaRuntime
  (``attribute_handlers`` argument).  Patch by Brian Moe.

* item assignments/lookups on Lua objects from Python no longer
  special case double underscore names (as opposed to attribute lookups)


0.21 (2014-02-12)
------------------

* some garbage collection issues were cleaned up using new Cython features

* new ``LuaRuntime`` option ``unpack_returned_tuples`` which automatically
  unpacks tuples returned from Python functions into separate Lua objects
  (instead of returning a single Python tuple object)

* some internal wrapper classes were removed from the module API

* Windows build fixes

* Py3.x build fixes

* support for building with Lua 5.1 instead of LuaJIT (setup.py --no-luajit)

* no longer uses Cython by default when building from released sources (pass
  ``--with-cython`` to explicitly request a rebuild)

* requires Cython 0.20+ when building from unreleased sources

* built with Cython 0.20.1


0.20 (2011-05-22)
------------------

* fix "deallocating None" crash while iterating over Lua tables in
  Python code

* support for filtering attribute access to Python objects for Lua
  code

* fix: setting source encoding for Lua code was broken


0.19 (2011-03-06)
------------------

* fix serious resource leak when creating multiple LuaRuntime instances

* portability fix for binary module importing


0.18 (2010-11-06)
------------------

* fix iteration by returning ``Py_None`` object for ``None`` instead
  of ``nil``, which would terminate the iteration

* when converting Python values to Lua, represent ``None`` as a
  ``Py_None`` object in places where ``nil`` has a special meaning,
  but leave it as ``nil`` where it doesn't hurt

* support for counter start value in ``python.enumerate()``

* native implementation for ``python.enumerate()`` that is several
  times faster

* much faster Lua iteration over Python objects


0.17 (2010-11-05)
------------------

* new helper function ``python.enumerate()`` in Lua that returns a Lua
  iterator for a Python object and adds the 0-based index to each
  item.

* new helper function ``python.iterex()`` in Lua that returns a Lua
  iterator for a Python object and unpacks any tuples that the
  iterator yields.

* new helper function ``python.iter()`` in Lua that returns a Lua
  iterator for a Python object.

* reestablished the ``python.as_function()`` helper function for Lua
  code as it can be needed in cases where Lua cannot determine how to
  run a Python function.


0.16 (2010-09-03)
------------------

* dropped ``python.as_function()`` helper function for Lua as all
  Python objects are callable from Lua now (potentially raising a
  ``TypeError`` at call time if they are not callable)

* fix regression in 0.13 and later where ordinary Lua functions failed
  to print due to an accidentally used meta table

* fix crash when calling ``str()`` on wrapped Lua objects without
  metatable


0.15 (2010-09-02)
------------------

* support for loading binary Lua modules on systems that support it


0.14 (2010-08-31)
------------------

* relicensed to the MIT license used by LuaJIT2 to simplify licensing
  considerations


0.13.1 (2010-08-30)
--------------------

* fix Cython generated C file using Cython 0.13


0.13 (2010-08-29)
------------------

* fixed undefined behaviour on ``str(lua_object)`` when the object's
  ``__tostring()`` meta method fails

* removed redundant "error:" prefix from ``LuaError`` messages

* access to Python's ``python.builtins`` from Lua code

* more generic wrapping rules for Python objects based on supported
  protocols (callable, getitem, getattr)

* new helper functions ``as_attrgetter()`` and ``as_itemgetter()`` to
  specify the Python object protocol used by Lua indexing when
  wrapping Python objects in Python code

* new helper functions ``python.as_attrgetter()``,
  ``python.as_itemgetter()`` and ``python.as_function()`` to specify
  the Python object protocol used by Lua indexing of Python objects in
  Lua code

* item and attribute access for Python objects from Lua code


0.12 (2010-08-16)
------------------

* fix Lua stack leak during table iteration

* fix lost Lua object reference after iteration


0.11 (2010-08-07)
------------------

* error reporting on Lua syntax errors failed to clean up the stack so
  that errors could leak into the next Lua run

* Lua error messages were not properly decoded


0.10 (2010-07-27)
------------------

* much faster locking of the LuaRuntime, especially in the single
  threaded case (see
  http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577336-fast-re-entrant-optimistic-lock-implemented-in-cyt/)

* fixed several error handling problems when executing Python code
  inside of Lua


0.9 (2010-07-23)
-----------------

* fixed Python special double-underscore method access on LuaObject
