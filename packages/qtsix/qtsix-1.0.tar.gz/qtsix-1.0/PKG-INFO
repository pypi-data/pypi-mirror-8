Description: QtSix provides a compatibility layer that allows to write Python
        applications that work with different Qt bindings: PyQt5, PyQt4 or
        PySide.
        
        An application that used QtSix can work correctly if any of the
        supported Qt bindings is installed on the system.
        QtSix automatically detects available bindings and uses them
        transparently.
        
        If more than one Qt_ binding is present on the system then it is selected
        the first one available in the following order: PyQt5, PyQt4, PySide.
