        This script is used for predicting subclone purity.

        Get the version of genome fasta that you mapped your fastqs, 
        we support hg18 and hg19 genome fasta now, take hg19 as an example
        
        .. code:: python
           
             ## use built-in script
             cd methylpurify/db
             bash genome.sh hg19
        
        
        Get Dependent software

        * `samtools <http://samtools.sourceforge.net>`_, version 0.2.0
        * `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_, version 1.8.2
        * `pyfasta`, version 0.5.2
        
        Easy to start

        Input: BAM file, this should be mapped with BSMap with -R option
        * `BSMap <https://code.google.com/p/bsmap/>`_
        
        Currently, we only support hg19 and hg18 genome index mapped BAM file.
        
        If your fastq mapping is done with hg19 index, use following command:
        
        .. code:: python
        
              MethylPurify -f input.bam -b 300 -c 10 -s 50 -i methylpurify/db/CGI_hg19_slop1000.bed -g /path/to/hg19.fa --cnv
        
        
        The results would be placed into *input* folder: alpha1.pred, MethylProfile.bed
        
        
        Options
        ````````````````
        * -f: input BAM file
        * -c: coverage level
        * -b: genome bin size
        * -s: sampling times
        * -g: species genome fasta file
        * -i: CG island specified, can use methylpurify/db/CGI_hg19_slop1000.bed for hg19, methylpurify/db/CGI_hg18_slop1000.bed for hg18
        * --cnv: use cnv data or not, only available for hg19, for other assembly, do not use this
