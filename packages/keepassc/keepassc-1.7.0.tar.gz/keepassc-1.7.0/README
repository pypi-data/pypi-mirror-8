Features:
---------
KeePassC is a password manager fully compatible to KeePass v.1.x and KeePassX. That is, your
password database is fully encrypted with AES.

KeePassC is written in Python 3 and comes with a curses-interface. It is completely controlled
with the keyboard.

Since v.1.6.0 network usage is implemented.

Install:
--------

First check if Python 3 is executed on your system with 'python' (e.g. ArchLinux) or with 'python3' (e.g. Fedora). If the latter applies open bin/keepassc with an editor of your choice and edit the first line to '#!/usr/bin/env python3', if the former do nothing.

If all dependencies are fulfilled type 'python setup.py install' resp. 'python3 setup.py install' in the root directory of KeePassC.

Furthermore check if the directory /var/empty exists (normally it should but it seems that is doesn't on Debian and derivates). If not execute as root user 'mkdir -m 755 /var/empty'.

Some users had problems to install PyCrypto in the right way on Ubuntu. Maybe this bash-script could help (written for Debian/Ubuntu like system; thx to iwfmp):

#!/bin/bash

if [[ -z `command -v keepassc` ]]; then
  sudo apt-get build-dep python-crypto
  githubRepos="dlitz/pycrypto raymontag/kppy raymontag/keepassc"
  for githubRepo in $githubRepos; do
    repoName=`echo ${githubRepo} | awk -F/ '{print $2}'`
    repoLocation=/usr/local/src/${repoName}
    sudo git clone https://github.com/${githubRepo} $repoLocation
    cd $repoLocation
    sudo python3 setup.py build
    sudo python3 setup.py install
  done
fi

Usage:
------
Start the program with 'keepassc'. To get help type 'F1' while KeePassC is executed and you will see usage
information to the current window (not in main menu).

For a short introduction have a look at http://raymontag.github.com/keepassc/docu.html. Also use 'man keepassc'.

For help using the server have a look at http://raymontag.github.com/keepassc/server.html, 'man keepassc-server' and 'man keepassc-agent'.

You can get help at any time by pressing F1 in the file or database browser.

Dependencies:
-------------

* Python 3 (>= 3.3)
* kppy http://www.nongnu.org/kppy
* xsel (optional but necessary if you want to copy usernames and passwords to clipboard)  http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/
* A POSIX-compatible operating system
