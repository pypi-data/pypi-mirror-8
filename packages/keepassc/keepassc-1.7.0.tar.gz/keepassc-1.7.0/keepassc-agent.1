.PP
This manpage describes the agent.
.SH SYNOPSIS
keepassc-agent [options] [cmd]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Since v.1.6.0 network usage is implemented. This manpage describes how to use the agent-daemon.
.SH USAGE
For a short introduction have a look at http://raymontag.github.com/keepassc/server.html.
.PP
You start the agent with 'keepassc-agent start'. You will be prompted for a password. If you need a keyfile use the -k option.
.PP
In the case above the agent is binded to 'localhost:50001'. The alwas binds always to localhost. If you want to use another port use -pc.
.PP
The agent uses 'localhost:50000' for the server address by default. If you want to use another server address use -as and -ps.
.PP
The agent is implemented as a daemon. Therefore commands to start and stop the agent are needed.
