ERPpeek's documentation
=======================

*A versatile tool for browsing Odoo / OpenERP data*

The ERPpeek library communicates with any `Odoo / OpenERP server`_ (>= 5.0)
using `the standard XML-RPC interface`_.

It provides both a :ref:`fully featured low-level API <client-and-services>`,
and an encapsulation of the methods on :ref:`Active Record objects
<model-and-records>`.  Additional helpers are provided to explore the model
and administrate the server remotely.

The :doc:`intro` describes its primary uses as a :ref:`command line tool
<command-line>` or within an :ref:`interactive shell <interactive-mode>`.

The :doc:`tutorial` gives an in-depth look at the capabilities.
