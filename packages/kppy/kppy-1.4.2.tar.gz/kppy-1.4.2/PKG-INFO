Description: kppy is a Python-module that provides full access to KeePass 1.x password databases which are used by the popular password manager KeePassX. Full access means:
        	- Open, save and close KP-files correctly
        	- Edit KP-files correctly and comfortable
        	- AES encryption
        	- First Python module for KeePass 1.x files that supports keyfiles, too.
        	- First Python-KeePass module for Python 3. (Python 2 is supported, too)
        Some explanation to KeePass databases: 
        	- Database files are encrypted with AES
        	- Database entries are sorted in groups
        	- Groups support subgroups
        	- Every entry has a title for better identification
        	- Expiration dates for entries
