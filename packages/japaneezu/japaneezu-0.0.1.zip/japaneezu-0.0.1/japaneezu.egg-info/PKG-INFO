Description: ``japaneezu`` is a language study tool with a curses interface that allows the user to "drill down" from the document
        to the phoneme level.
        
        Any document or set of documents can be used as a study tool. Automatic, integrated pronunciation, dictionary, language
        parsing, conjugation, etc. are supported.
        
        Plans for integration with `Anki <http://ankisrs.net/>`_ and other tools are in the works.
        
        Multi-language support is planned, but currently Japanese is the only supported target language.
