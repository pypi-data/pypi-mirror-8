Why did I build this?
---------------------

I was setting up IPython Notebook on heroku, and ran into the problem
where heroku will remove the extra files after a while. Having used
mongodb quite thoroughly before, and knowing the existence of the free
mongodb host (up to 500mb, which I believe is more than enough for most
users of IPython Notebook), mongolab, I decided to write a module that
will enable persistence of the notebooks on heroku, hence this plugin.
