Description: 
        	Encryption/decryption daemon that handles requests via unix domain sockets. The daemon
        	can be run on a container host, and trusted Docker containers can mount the socket
        	directory to decrypt sensitive configuration values (i.e. credentials) without
        	requiring direct access to the private key.
        
        	Due to the messy state of Python encryption libraries related to S/MIME and PKCS#7,
        	OpenSSL binaries are required.
