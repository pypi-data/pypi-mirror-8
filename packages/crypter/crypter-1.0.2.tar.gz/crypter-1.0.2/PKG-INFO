Description: 
        	Encryption/decryption daemon that handles requests via unix domain sockets. The daemon
        	can be run on a container host, and trusted Docker containers can mount the socket
        	directory to decrypt sensitive configuration values (i.e. credentials) without
        	requiring direct access to the private key.
