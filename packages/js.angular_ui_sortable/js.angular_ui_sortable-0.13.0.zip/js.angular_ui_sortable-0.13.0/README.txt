js.angular_ui_sortable
**********************

Introduction
============

This library packages `Angular UI Sortable`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Angular UI Sortable`: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-sortable

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.angular_ui_sortable``) are published to some URL.
