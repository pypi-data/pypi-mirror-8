Thanks to Aleksander Korzynski and Stanis≈Çaw Pitucha for taking the
original design spec and some basic manual steps and experiementing
with initial implementations.

To Davide Guerri, for picking up a rough python tool and turning it
into something that was actually usable.

Also to Jon Paul Sullivan and Monty Taylor to listening and providing
a sounding board for different approaches.

And finally to Coleman Corrigan among numerous others who acted as
willing guinea pigs for the original manual approach. Hope this
eventually helped save you time and some hair.
