What is git-upstream?

git-upstream is an open source Python application that can be used to keep in
sync with upstream open source projects, mainly OpenStack.

git-upstream provides new git subcommands to support rebasing of local-carried
patches on top of upstream repositories. It provides commands to ease the use of
git for who needs to integrate big upstream projects in their environment (i.e.,
feature branch creation/finishing, release starting/finishing).
The operations are performed using Git commands.
