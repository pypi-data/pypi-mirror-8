**APSG** defines several new python classes to easily manage, analyze
and visualize orientational structural geology data. Base class ``Vec3``
is derived from ``numpy.array`` class and affers several new method
which will be explained on following examples.

Basic usage
-----------

APSG module could be imported either into own namespace or into
active one for easier interactive work::

    from apsg import *

Basic operations with vectors
-----------------------------

Instance of vector object ``Vec3`` could be created from any iterable
object as list, tuple or array::

    >>> u = Vec3([1, -2, 3])
    >>> v = Vec3([-2, 1, 1])

For common vector operation we can use standard mathematical operators
or special methods using dot notation::

    >>> u+v
    V(-1.000, -1.000, 4.000)
    >>> u-v
    V(3.000, -3.000, 2.000)
    >>> 3*u-2*v
    V(7.000, -8.000, 7.000)

Its magnitude or length is most commonly defined as its Euclidean norm
and could be calculated using ``abs``::

    >>> abs(v)
    2.4494897427831779
    >>> abs(u+v)
    4.2426406871192848

For *dot product* we can use multiplification operator ``*``
or ``dot`` method::

    >>> u*v
    -1
    >>> u.dot(v)
    -1

For *cross product* we can use operator ``**`` or method ``cross``::

    >>> u**v
    V(-5.000, -7.000, -3.000)
    >>> u.cross(v)
    V(-5.000, -7.000, -3.000)

To project vector ``u`` onto vector ``v`` we can use
method ``proj``::

    >>> u.proj(v)
    V(0.333, -0.167, -0.167)

To find angle (in degrees) between to vectors we use method ``angle``::

    >>> u.angle(v)
    96.263952719927218

Method ``rotate`` provide possibility to rotate vector around
another vector. For example, to rotate vector ``u`` around
vector ``v`` for 45Â°::

    >>> u.rotate(v,45)
    V(2.248, 0.558, 2.939)

Classes Lin and Fol
-------------------

To work with orientational data in structural geology, APSG
provide two classes derived from ``Vec3`` class. There is ``Fol``
class to represent planar features by planes and ``Lin`` class
to represent linear feature by lines. Both classes provide all
``Vec3`` methods, but they differ in way how instance is created
and how some operations are calculated, as structural geology
data are commonly axial in nature.

To create instance of ``Lin`` or ``Fol`` class, we have to provide
dip direction and dip, both in degrees::

    >>> Lin(120,60)
    L:120/60
    >>> Fol(216,62)
    S:216/62

or we can create instance from ``Vec3`` object using ``aslin``
and ``asfol`` properties::

    >>> u.aslin
    L:297/53
    >>> u.asfol
    S:117/37

Vec3 methods for Lin and Fol
----------------------------

To find angle between two linear or planar features::

    >>> l1 = Lin(110,40)
    >>> l2 = Lin(160,30)
    >>> l1.angle(l2)
    41.597412680035468
    >>> p1 = Fol(330,50)
    >>> p2 = Fol(250,40)
    >>> p1.angle(p2)
    54.696399321975328

To construct planar feature defined by two linear features::

    >>> l1**l2
    S:113/40

To construct linear feature defined as intersection of two planar features::

    >>> p1**p2
    L:278/36

**Cross product** of planar and linear features could be used to construct
plane defined by linear feature and normal of planar feature::

    >>> l2**p2
    S:96/53

or to find perpendicular linear feature on given plane::

    >>> p2**l2
    L:276/37

To rotate structural features we can use method ``rotate``::

    >>> p2.rotate(l2,45)
    

Group class
-----------

``Group`` class serve as a homogeneous container for ``Lin`` or ``Fol`` objects.
It allows grouping of features either for visualization or batch analysis.

    >>> d = Group([Lin(120,60), Lin(116,50), Lin(132,45), Lin(90,60), Lin(84,52)], name='L1')
    >>> d
    L1: 5 Lin

Method ``len`` returns number of features in group::

    >>> len(d)
    5

Property ``resultant`` gives mean or resultant of all features in group::

    >>> d.resultant
    L:110/55

To measure angles between all features in group and another feature,
we can use method ``angle``::

    >>> d.angle(d.resultant)
    array([  7.60329482,   6.24648167,  17.37186861,  11.6536752 ,  15.3996262 ])

To rotate all features in group around another feature,
we can use method ``rotate``::

    >>> dr = d.rotate(Lin(150, 30), 45)

To show data in list you can convert it to python ``list``::

    >>> list(dr)
    [L:107/35, L:113/26, L:126/30, L:93/26, L:94/18]

To calculate orientation tensor of all features in group,
we can use method ``ortensor``::

    >>> d.ortensor
    Ortensor:
    (E1:4.77,E2:0.2011,E3:0.02874)
    [[ 0.36990905 -0.48027385 -0.71621555]
     [-0.48027385  1.42230591  2.10464496]
     [-0.71621555  2.10464496  3.20778504]]

Ortensor class
--------------

``Ortensor`` class represents orientation tensor of set of planar
or linear features. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors could be obtained
by methods ``eigenvals`` and ``eigenvects``. Eigenvectors could be also
represented by linear or planar features using properties eigenlins
and eigenfols::

    >>> ot = Ortensor(d)
    >>> ot.eigenvals
    (0.95403846865963882, 0.040212749461964618, 0.0057487818783964056)
    >>> ot.eigenvects
    Default: 3 Vec3
    >>> list(ot.eigenlins)
    [L:110/55, L:5/10, L:268/33]
    >>> list(ot.eigenfols)
    [S:290/35, S:185/80, S:88/57]

StereoNet class
---------------

Any ``Fol``, ``Lin``, ``Vec3`` or ``Group`` object could be visualized
in stereographic projection using mplstereonet (https://github.com/joferkington/mplstereonet),
which must be accessible on current PYTHONPATH. Hi-level commands are adopted
for APSG objects, while all original ``mplstereonet`` methods and properties
are accessible trough 'ax' property::

    >>> s = StereoNet()
    >>> s.plane(Fol(150,40))
    >>> s.pole(Fol(150,40))
    >>> s.line(Lin(112,30))
    >>> s.grid()
    >>> plt.show()

A ``Group`` object could be plotted as well::

    >>> s = StereoNet()
    >>> g = Group([Lin(120,60), Lin(116,50), Lin(132,45), Lin(95,52)], name='Test')
    >>> s.line(g, 'ro')
    >>> s.grid()
    >>> plt.show()

To make density contours plots, a ``density_contour`` and ``density_contourf``
methods are available::

    >>> s = StereoNet()
    >>> g = Group.randn_lin(mean=Lin(40,30))
    >>> s.density_contourf(g, levels=range(1,50,5), cmap='gray_r')
    >>> s.density_contour(g, levels=range(1,50,5), colors='k')
    >>> s.line(g, 'k.')
    >>> plt.show()

Some tricks
-----------

Double cross product is allowed::

    >>> s = StereoNet()
    >>> p = Fol(250,40)
    >>> l = Lin(160,25)
    >>> s.plane(p, 'b')
    >>> s.line(l, 'bo')
    >>> s.plane(l**p, 'g')
    >>> s.line(p**l, 'go')
    >>> s.plane(l**p**l, 'r')
    >>> s.line(p**l**p, 'ro')
    >>> plt.show()

    :align: center

Correct measurements of planar linear pairs::

    >>> from apsg.core import fixpair
    >>> p1, l1 = fixpair(p,l)
    >>> s = StereoNet()
    >>> s.plane(p, 'b')
    >>> s.line(l, 'bo')
    >>> s.plane(p1, 'g')
    >>> s.line(l1, 'go')
    >>> plt.show()
