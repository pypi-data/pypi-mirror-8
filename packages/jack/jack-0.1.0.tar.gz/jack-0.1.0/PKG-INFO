        ## How to create and ship a change
        
        * Mark your change in a branch off `master` and submit a pull-request on GitHub. Ping @dbader to review it.
        
        #### Testing
        * Test the package locally and make sure it installs cleanly and works via `pip install -e .` (in the project root).
        
        #### Releasing
        * Bump `PACKAGE_VERSION` in `setup.py`
        * Create a git tag for the release:
            * `git tag 0.0.1 -m "The best release so far"`
            * `git push --tags origin master`
        * `python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi`
        
        ## Roadmap
        
        * Turn this into a `pip install`able package
        * Add usage / nice errors for the CLI
        * Add unit tests
        * Set up TravisCI continuous integration
        
        ## Changelog
        
        * `0.1.0`: First working PyPI release.
