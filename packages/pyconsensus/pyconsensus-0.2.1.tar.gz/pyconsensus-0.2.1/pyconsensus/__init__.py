"""Consensus mechanism for Truthcoin.

pyconsensus is a Python implementation of the Truthcoin consensus mechanism,
described in detail at https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin.

Usage:

    #   - each row represents a voter
    #   - each column represents a decision in a prediction market
    my_votes = [[1, 1, 0, 0],

                [1, 1, 0, 0],
                [1, 1, 1, 0],
                [0, 0, 1, 1],
                [0, 0, 1, 1]]
