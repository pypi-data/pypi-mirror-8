ownCloud and Seafile conflict files resolver
============================================

ownCloud often generates bunch of conflict files. Seafile is far better, but it happens. Some of conflict files are completely senseless (they are equivalent to non conflict files laying beside them), some of them really differs from their neighborhoods. The aim of this script is to resolve conflict files of both types. 

Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`python3.3` or newer.

Python 3.3 specific packages: `pathlib flufl.enum`.

Additional
""""""""""

Python package: `send2trash` (for deleting files to trash).

`kdiff3` (for file comparison).


Usage
-----

Simple execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   cloud-resolve-conflicts ~/ownCloud

This executes backup of all conflict files into `~/ownCloud/conflict_files_backup.tar`, removes all senseless conflict files (permanently) and asks your decision for real conflict files (it shows `kdiff3` window with files opened side by side). You can specify other program such as `vimdiff` or `meld` with the option `--program-name`.

Removing all conflict files with extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing all conflict `*.aux` files (with their corresponding normal files) in current directory using `ag` and `pyp` (you can use `grep` and `xargs` if you prefer):

.. code:: bash

   cloud-resolve-conflicts --list-all | ag '.aux$' | pyp "'rm \"{}\"'.format(p)" | sh

(simplier examples with proper spaces escaping are welcome)

Other usages
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more options (such as disabling backups, deleting files to trash, using different compare program, etc.) use:

.. code:: bash

   cloud-resolve-conflicts --help
