Description: ownCloud and Seafile conflict files resolver
        ============================================
        
        ownCloud often generates bunch of conflict files. Seafile is far better, but it happens. Some of conflict files are completely senseless (they are equivalent to non conflict files laying beside them), some of them really differs from their neighborhoods. The aim of this script is to resolve conflict files of both types. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `python3.3` or newer.
        
        Python 3.3 specific packages: `pathlib flufl.enum`.
        
        Additional
        """"""""""
        
        Python package: `send2trash` (for deleting files to trash).
        
        `kdiff3` (for file comparison).
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Simple execution
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           cloud-resolve-conflicts ~/ownCloud
        
        This executes backup of all conflict files into `~/ownCloud/conflict_files_backup.tar`, removes all senseless conflict files (permanently) and asks your decision for real conflict files (it shows `kdiff3` window with files opened side by side). You can specify other program such as `vimdiff` or `meld` with the option `--program-name`.
        
        Removing all conflict files with extension
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Removing all conflict `*.aux` files (with their corresponding normal files) in current directory using `ag` and `pyp` (you can use `grep` and `xargs` if you prefer):
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           cloud-resolve-conflicts --list-all | ag '.aux$' | pyp "'rm \"{}\"'.format(p)" | sh
        
        (simplier examples with proper spaces escaping are welcome)
        
        Other usages
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For more options (such as disabling backups, deleting files to trash, using different compare program, etc.) use:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           cloud-resolve-conflicts --help

        --------
        
        I wrote this script for myself and used it successfully. I hope this program will work for you too. I wrote some tests to be sure that it will do things correctly. But as always:
