    """Generates all combinations of parameters.

    The aim of this function is, given a list of experiment parameters
    (named factors), and for each parameter (factor), the list of
    their possible values (named levels), to generate the cartesian
    product of all parameter values, for a full factorial experimental
    design (*The Art Of Computer Systems Performance Analysis,
    R. Jain, Wiley 1991*).

    More formally: given a a dict associating factors as keys and the
    list of their possible levels as values, this function will return
    a list of dict corresponding to all cartesian product of all level
    combinations. Each dict in the returned list associates the
    factors as keys, and one of its possible levels as value.

    In the given factors dict, if for a factor X (key), the value
    associated is a dict instead of a list of levels, then it will use
    the keys of the sub-dict as levels for the factor X, and the
    values of the sub-dict must also be some dict for factor / levels
    combinations which will be explored only for the corresponding
    levels of factor X. This is kind of recursive sub-sweep and it
    allows to explore some factor / level combinations only for some
    levels of a given factor.

    The returned list contains `execo_engine.sweep.HashableDict`
    instead of dict, which is a simple subclass of dict, so that
    parameters combinations can be used as dict keys (but don't modify
    them in such cases)

class ParamSweeper(object):

    """Multi-process-safe, thread-safe and persistent iterable container to iterate over a list of experiment parameters (or whatever, actually).

    The aim of this class is to provide a convenient way to iterate
    over several experiment configurations (or anything else). It is
    an iterable container with the following characteristics:

    - each element of the iterable has four states:

      - *todo*

      - *inprogress*

      - *done*

      - *skipped*

    - at beginning, each element is in state *todo*

    - client code can mark any element *done* or *skipped*

    - when iterating over it, you always get the next item in *todo*
      state

    - this container has automatic persistence of the element states
      *done* and *inprogress* (but not state *skipped*) to disk: If
      later you instanciate a container with the same persistence
      directory (path to is given to constructor), then the elements
      of the container will be taken from the constructor argument,
      but states *done* or *inprogress* will be loaded from persistent
      state.

    - this container is thread-safe and multi-process-safe. Multiple
      threads can concurrently use a single ParamSweeper
      object. Multiple threads or processes on the same or different
      hosts can concurrently use several ParamSweeper instances
      sharing the same persistence directory. With sufficiently recent
      linux kernels and nfs servers / clients, it will work on a
      shared nfs storage (current implementation uses python flock,
      which should work since kernel 2.6.12. see
      http://nfs.sourceforge.net/#faq_d10). All threads sharing a
      ParamSweeper instance synchronize through in-process locks, and
      all threads / processes with different instances of ParamSweeper
      sharing the same persistent directory synchronize through the
      persisted state.

    This container is intended to be used in the following way: at the
    beginning of the experiment, you initialize a ParamSweeper with
    the list of experiment configurations (which can result from a
    call to `execo_engine.sweep.sweep`, but not necessarily) and a
    directory for the persistence. During execution, you request
    (possibly from several concurrent threads or processes) new
    experiment configurations with
    `execo_engine.sweep.ParamSweeper.get_next`, mark them *done* or
    *skipped* with `execo_engine.sweep.ParamSweeper.done` and
    `execo_engine.sweep.ParamSweeper.skip`. At a later date, you can
    relaunch the same script, it will continue from where it left,
    also retrying the skipped configurations. This works well when
    used with `execo_engine.engine.Engine` startup option ``-c``
    (continue experiment in a given directory).

    State *inprogress* is stored on disk to avoid concurrent processes
    to get the same elements from different ParamSweeper instances (to
    avoid duplicating work). In some cases (for example if a process
    has crashed without marking an element *done* or *skipped* or
    cancelling it), you may want to reset the *inprogress* state. This
    can be done by removing the file ``inprogress`` in the persistence
    directory (this can even be done while some ParamSweeper are
    instanciated and using it).

    ParamSweeper handle crashes in the following ways: if it crashes
    (or is killed) while synchronizing to disk, in the worst case, the
    current element marked done can be lost (i.e. other ParamSweepers
    or later instanciations will not see it marked done), or the whole
    list of inprogress elements can be lost.

    The ParamSweeper code assumes that in typical usage, there may be
    a huge number of elements to iterate on (and accordingly, the list
    of done elements will grow huge too), and that the number of
    inprogress elements will stay reasonably low. The whole iterable
    of elements is (optionnaly) written to disk only once, at
    ParamSweeper construction. The set of done elements can only grow
    and is incrementaly appended. The set of inprogress elements is
    fully read from and written to disk at each operation, thus this
    may become a bottleneck to ParamSweeper performance if the set of
    inprogress elements is big.
