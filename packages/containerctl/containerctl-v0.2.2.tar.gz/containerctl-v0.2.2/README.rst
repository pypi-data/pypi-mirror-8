containerctl
============
A tool for building and running `Docker`_
containers.

Configuration
-------------
The containerctl commandline utility loads `Docker`_ container information from
a config file in the project directory. The name of the config file should be
``container.yml`` or ``.container.yml``. The first readable file found (in that
order) is used. The project directory will be the cwd unless set by providing
``path``. The ``path`` is an option to each containerctl command.

The ``container.yml`` file determines the user, name, version, path, and `fig`_
configuration of the container. The following directives are supported:

-   ``name`` - The name part of the Docker tag. If of the form ``user/name``
    the user part is copied into ``user``. This is the only required value.
-   ``user`` - The user part of the Docker tag.
-   ``version`` - Set to hardcode the version part of the container tag.
-   ``path`` - The path to the directory containing the container's Dockerfile
    and context. Defaults to the path value provided to containerctl which is
    usually cwd.
-   ``prebuild`` - A command to execute just prior to calling
    ``docker build`` on a container.
-   ``running`` - `Fig`_ configuration. Used to run the container. The values
    of ``user``, ``name``, ``tag``, and ``version`` may be substituted into the
    `fig`_ configuration using the double-brace syntax. So, for instance,
    {{tag}} would be replaced with the full tag name of the container. If
    ``|fig`` is appended to the value name it will be converted to a name
    suitable for a fig container.
-   ``testing`` - Additional `Fig`_ configuration used by the test command.
    Containers defined here are used in addition to those found in ``running``.
    Nameing a container in ``testing`` the same as one in ``running`` will
    replace that container. There must be a container named ``test`` for the
    test command to work. This container is run using ``fig run``. The exit
    code of the command should be used to determine the success of the tests.

The following config example would allow you to build an nginx container and
run it with an example website located in a separate container::

    name: example/nginx
    running:
        site:
            image: example/website
        nginx:
            image: {{tag}}
            ports:
            - 80
            volumes_from:
            - site
    testing:
        test:
            build: tests
            links:
            - nginx:www.example.net

Prebuild
--------
containerctl supports executing a script just prior to a build. By convention
this should be an executable file called ``prebuild`` in the container
directory. If this file exists it will be executed. A different prebuild
command may be excuted by setting the ``prebuild`` configuration directive.

Version Detection
-----------------
If no version is provided in the config file an attempt is made to detect the
version of the container. First the existance of an executable called
``version`` is checked for in the container directory.  If found the first line
of this executable's output is used.

If the ``version`` executable does not exist an attempt is made to determine
the current git tag of the repository the container resides in. This will fail
if the container is not in a git repo or the git command is missing. If HEAD is
not tagged then the short form of the commit hash is appended to ``rev-`` to
create a commit specific version.

Should none of the above attempts yield a version the container version will
fall back to the default value of ``latest``.

Available Commands
------------------
The following commands are available to containerctl:

-   ``build`` - Build the container. The container is tagged as
    ``user/name:version``.
-   ``info`` - Print information about the container.
-   ``push`` - Push the container to the remote repository.
-   ``rm`` - Remove the container's image from Docker.
-   ``run`` - Run the container. Requires `fig`_.
-   ``test`` - Test the container. Requires `fig`_. Runs the defined test
    container.

These are just brief descriptions. See ``containerctl help COMMAND`` for full
usage details of each.
