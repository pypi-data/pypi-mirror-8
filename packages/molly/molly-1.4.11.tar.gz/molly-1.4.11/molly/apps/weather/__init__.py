Weather application
* Grabs weather from defined providers
* Stores a single (latest) observation
* Stores historical forecast data (not well defined)
* Can only handle ONE provider at once.

The application could do with being reengineered. Especially for more
real time data sources. The current object model is a tad muddled.
