          [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

        - Disable daemonization on the windows platform. Closes #141. [Jose
          Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Move file unwatching in old-style worker out of for-loop. Refs #139.
          [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          Each worker has a `self._file_map` attribute which is a mapping of
          file ids to file data. When retrieving lines or checking on the status
          of the file, we use `iteritems()` which gives us a generator as
          opposed to a copy such as with `items()`. This generator allows us to
          iterate over the files without having issues where the file handle may
          open several times or other random Python issues.  Using a generator
          also means that the set that we are iterating over should not change
          mid-iteration, which it does if a file is unwatched. To circumvent
          this, we should use a separate list to keep track of files we need to
          unwatch or rewatch, and do it out of band.  We should also take care
          to catch `RuntimeError` which may arise when closing the Worker out of
          band - such as in the `cleanup` step of the worker dispatcher - but
          nowhere else.  This should fix issues where logrotate suddenly causes
          files to disappear for a time and beaver tries to tail the file at the
          exact time it is being recreated.
        
        - Merge pull request #140 from jonathanq/master. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          Fixed a typo on the SQS docs
        
        - Remove ujson requirement. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          This allows users that do not have a compiler in their deployment area
          to install beaver.    Closes #137
        
        - Turn on logfile output when running in non-daemon contexts. Closes
          #131. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Expand logging output path. Closes #133. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Ensure logging to a file does not destroy regular logging. Closes
          #132. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Properly handle unreadable files by logging a warning instead of
          crashing. Closes #130. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Rename null_formatter to raw_formatter in BaseTransport class. [Jose
          Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Ensure that the RedisTransport calls the super invalidate method. Refs
          #93. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

          Adding HA options for rabbitmq
        
        - Respect stat_interval file configuration in stable worker. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
        - Unified configuration file using conf_d module. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          This change adds support for a conf.d directory - configured only via
          the `--confd-path` flag - which allows beaver to read configuration
          from multiple files.  Please note that the primary `beaver` stanza
          MUST be located in the file specified by the `--configfile` argument.
          Any other such `beaver` stanzas will be ignored.  This change also
          unifies the `BeaverConfig` and `FileConfig` classes, and simplifies
          the api for retrieving global vs file-specific data.  Please note that
          this commit BREAKS custom transport classes, as the interface for
          creating a transport class has changed. If you are referencing a
          `file_config.get(field, filename)` anywhere, please omit this and
          refer to `beaver_config.get_field(field, filename)`.  Closes #107

          Gonzalez]
        
        - Log to debug instead of warning for file reloading on Darwin
          architectures. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Speed up experimental worker. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          - Removed inline sleep call, which slowed down passes n*0.1 seconds,
          where n is the number of files being tailed - Inline methods that
          update data structures which should speed up larger installations -
          Make self.active() an attribute lookup instead of a method call
        
        - Update rawjson formatter to build the correct output. Closes #127.
          [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Use latest version of message pack interface (0.3.0). Closes #128.

        - Specify a max queue size of 100 to limit overrunning memory. [Jose
          Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Use multiprocessing for handling larger queue sizes. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
          Previously there were issues where files that were updated frequently
          - such as varnish or server logs - would overwhelm the naive
          implementation of file.readlines() within Beaver. This would cause
          Beaver to slowly read larger and larger portions of a file before
          processing any of the lines, eventually causing Beaver to take forever
          to process log lines.  This patch adds the ability to use an internal
          work queue for log lines. Whenever file.readlines() is called, the
          lines are placed in the queue, which is shared with a child process.
          The child process creates its own transport, allowing us to
          potentially create a Process Pool in the future to handle a larger
          queue size.  Note that the limitation of file.readlines() reading in
          too many lines is still in existence, and may continue to cause issues
          for certain log files.

          iteration. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

        - Revert "Added a lightweight Event class" [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          After deliberation, beaver is meant to be "light-weight". Lets leave
          the heavy-hitting to the big-boys.  This reverts commit
          1619d33ef4803c3fe910cf4ff197d0dd0039d2eb.
        
        - Added a lightweight Event class. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          This class's sole responsibility will be the processing of a given
          line as an event. It's future goal will be to act as a lightweight
          implementation of the filter system within Logstash
        
        - Remove argparse requirement for python 2.7 and above. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
        - Release version 15. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Updated readme. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Pull argument parsing out of beaver __init__.py. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Move app-running into __init__.py. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Update worker to follow variable naming conventions. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
        - Standardize on _parse() as method for parsing config. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
        - Automatically parse the path config option. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Remove extensions argument on Worker class. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          This argument was only used when no globs were specified in a config
          file. Since it is not configurable, there is no sense leaving around
          the extra logic.
        
        - Remove extra callback invocation on readlines. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Remove extra file_config module. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - General code reorganization. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          Move both BeaverConfig and FileConfig into a single class
          Consolidated run_worker code with code in beaver binary file. This
          will create a clearer path for Exception handling, as it is now the
          responsibility of the calling class, allowing us to remove duplicative
          exception handling code.  Added docstrings to many fuctions and
          methods  Moved extra configuration and setup code to beaver.utils
          module. In many cases, code was added hastily before.  Made many
          logger calls debug as opposed to info. The info level should be
          generally reserved for instances where files are watched, unwatched,
          or some change in the file state has occurred.
        
        - Remove duplicative and old beaver instructions from binary. [Jose
          Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Remove unnecessary passing of ssh_tunnel subprocess. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
        - Added docstrings to ssh_tunnel module. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Follow convention of underscore for object properties. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
        - Follow convention of underscore for object properties. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
        - Added a NullFormatter. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          Useful for cases where we do not want any extra overhead on message
          formatting
        
        - Refactored message formatting in base Transport class. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
          We now use a `_formatter` property on the Transport class which will
          properly process the message for output as the user expects.  In the
          case of string output, we define a custom formatter using an anonymous
          function and specify that as the formatter.
        
        - Moved create_transport to transport module. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Moved create_ssh_tunnel to ssh_tunnel module. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Fixed order of beaver_config and file_config in args. [Jose Diaz-
          Gonzalez]
        
        - Reduce overhead of parsing configuration for globs and files. [Jose
          Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Removed ordereddict dependency. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Do not output info level when outputing version. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Updated requirements for Python 2.6. Closes #77. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

        - Fixed certain environment variables. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - SSH Tunnel Support. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
          This code should allow us to create an ssh tunnel between two distinct
          servers for the purposes of sending and receiving data.  This is
          useful in certain cases where you would otherwise need to whitelist in
          your Firewall or iptables setup, such as when running in two different
          regions on AWS.
        
        - Allow for initial connection lag. Helpful when waiting for an SSH
          proxy to connect. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Fix issue where certain config defaults were of an improper value.
          [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
        
        - Allow specifying host via flag. Closes #70. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]
