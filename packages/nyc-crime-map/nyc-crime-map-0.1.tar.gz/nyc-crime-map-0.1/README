Get data from the `NYC Crime Map <http://maps.nyc.gov/crime/>`_,
and save them as geojson files.

Getting data I have already saved
================================================
If you just want to get the data in geojson or CSV format, go to
http://small.dada.pink/nyc-crime-map-data/.

Running the program
========================================
If you want to run the program, perhaps to get the most recent data,
you can run the program. I present a couple ways of doing this.

Installing from PyPI
-------------------------
You can install the package like so ::

    sudo pip install nyc-crime-map

and then run it like so. ::

    nyc-crime-map

A ``data`` directory will be created inside your working directory,
and you'll find the results here. ::

    cat nyc-crime-map/data/02378420399528461352-17772055697785505571.geojson
    cat nyc-crime-map/data/02378420399528461352-17772055697785505571.csv

Running from the checked-out repository
------------------------------------------
Perhaps you don't have pip installed; in that case, you can do this. ::

    git clone git://github.com/tlevine/nyc-crime-map.git --recursive

    # Delete the cached data.
    rm nyc-crime-map/data/all_results/*

    # Run the program.
    cd nyc-crime-map
    ./nyc-crime-map

    # View the results.
    cat nyc-crime-map/data/02378420399528461352-17772055697785505571.geojson
    cat nyc-crime-map/data/02378420399528461352-17772055697785505571.csv

More about the data
=========================================
The data are stored in two tables.

* 02378420399528461352-11853667273131550346
* 02378420399528461352-17772055697785505571

The latter of these tables contains a "CR" field for the crime type;
the former does not.
