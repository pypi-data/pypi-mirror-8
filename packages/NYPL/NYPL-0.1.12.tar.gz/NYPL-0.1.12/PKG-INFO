        Output
        ---
        Results are output as a list of Book objects, which have the following attributes:
         - author
         - title (in the format "title (genre)" )
         - link_to_copies (url to a page of the libraries that have the book) 
         - copies (a list of all copies of the book)* 
         - available_copies (a list of *available* copies of the book)*
         
        copies and available_copies are represented as lists of Copy objects, which have the following attributes:
         - location (eg. "96th Street")
         - collection (eg. "96th Street Children's Fiction")
         - callNo (call number, eg. "J FIC K"
         - status (eg. "DUE 10-28-14")
         
        * copies and available copies are not generated automatically with default search. They can be generated automatically with robust search:
        
        search(keyword, title, author, lazy=False)

        --------
        
        Unfortunately, the official New York Public Library is only available to library employees, and during library hack-a-thons. Now, it's data anytime--Happy developing!
