"We've all done it.  In the process of writing a brand new application "
"we've\n"
"discovered that we need a little bit of code that we've invented before.\n"
"Perhaps it's something to handle unicode text.  Perhaps it's something to"
" make\n"
"a bit of python-2.5 code run on python-2.3.  Whatever it is, it ends up "
"being\n"
"a tiny bit of code that seems too small to worry about pushing into its "
"own\n"
"module so it sits there, a part of your current project, waiting to be "
"cut and\n"
"pasted into your next project.  And the next.  And the next.  And since "
"that\n"
"little bittybit of code proved so useful to you, it's highly likely that "
"it\n"
"proved useful to someone else as well.  Useful enough that they've "
"written it\n"
"and copy and pasted it over and over into each of their new projects.\n"
"\n"
"Well, no longer!  Kitchen aims to pull these small snippets of code into "
"a few\n"
"python modules which you can import and use within your project.  No more"
" copy\n"
"and paste!  Now you can let someone else maintain and release these small"
"\n"
"snippets so that you can get on with your life.\n"
