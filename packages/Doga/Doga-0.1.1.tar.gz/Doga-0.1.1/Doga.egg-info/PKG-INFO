            HTTP log monitoring console for Humans
        
        -  watch and log all HTTP traffic of system
        -  generate log in w3c log format
        -  show status about total requests, maximum hits, requests in a
           timespan
        -  alert when traffic is above a customizable threshold
        -  can log in a custom log file also
        
        How to let Doga watch for your traffic
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
            wait is over and Doga is on pypi now :
            `Doga <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Doga>`__
        
        -  use either ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` to install ``Doga``
        -  for ``pip`` : ``sudo pip install doga``
        -  run it with ``sudo doga`` (as it require higher privilege than a
           regular user have)
        -  change between logs and history section in application using
           ``Ctrl+N``
        -  exit of application by selecting ``cancel``
        -  write logs to a custom log file using ``sudo doga -f filename.txt``
        
        
            Doga's GUI is not responsive yet so it will raise exceptions on
            smaller screen size.
        
        How it's made
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Doga's GUI is built on top of
           `npyscreen <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/npyscreen>`__
        -  Doga uses Python's `socket
           interface <https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html>`__ library
           to deal with all TCP/IP/Packets and *Bla Bla Bla* things
