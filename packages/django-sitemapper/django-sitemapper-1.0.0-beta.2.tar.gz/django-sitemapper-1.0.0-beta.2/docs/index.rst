Welcome to django-sitemapper's documentation!
=============================================


Sitemapper is a Django app to manage sitemap.xml overrides on a
per-object basis.

Migrations are provided for both Django 1.7+ and earlier versions using
`South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_.



Getting started
---------------

The first thing you'll need to do is check out the
:doc:`installation guide and requirements</install>`.

If you're familiar with installing Django apps then the installation is totally
standard, with no additional dependencies.
