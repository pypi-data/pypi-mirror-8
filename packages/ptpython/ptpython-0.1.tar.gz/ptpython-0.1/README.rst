ptpython
========

`ptpython` is a Python REPL build on top of the `prompt_toolkit
<http://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`_ library. For now
it's still still shipped with ``prompt_toolkit`` itself. Maybe, later on (when
APIs are sure to be stable) we will pull it out and put it here instead.

To install ``ptpython``, run:

::

    pip install prompt-toolkit
