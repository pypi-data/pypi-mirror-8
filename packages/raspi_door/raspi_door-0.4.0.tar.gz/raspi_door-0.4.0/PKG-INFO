        Raspberry Pi Smart-ish Door
        ===========================
        
        .. WARNING::
        
          2014/09/24: this project is not fully functional yet -- come back in
          a month or so.
        
        .. IMPORTANT::
        
          IN CASE YOU MISSED THE "WARNING", THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY
          "PRE-ALPHA", WHICH MEANS IT DOES NOT WORK YET.
        
        The `raspi-door` project comprises the GUI that is run on the
        Raspberry PI on the inside of the door so that you can control your
        door with *awesomeness*... or, as close as I can get it there.

        Raspi-Door Hardware
        ===================
        
        TODO.
        
        
        Raspi-Door Software
        ===================
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          # (optional) create a virtualenv for raspi-door
          $ virtualenv --prompt '(raspi-door) ' /path/to/virtualenv
          $ . /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
        
          # install pre-requisites that have problems with pip...
          # TODO: figure out why this is necessary...
          $ easy_install pygame==1.9.1release pgu==0.18
        
          $ pip install raspi-door
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        * ``"ImportError: No module named pkg_resources"``
        
          If you run into an issue during the install process and pip just
          doesn't work anymore, you may need to re-install
          setuptools. However, you need to do this without using `pip` or
          `easy_install`... so, check https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
          for direct installation details, i.e.:
        
          .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python
