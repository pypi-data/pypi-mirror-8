``repoze.zcml`` is a package which provides basic ZCML directives for
the Zope Component Architecture (such as ``utility``, ``subscriber``,
and ``adapter``).  You should use ``repoze.zcml`` if your application
doesn't need the more advanced features of the "stock" directive types
of the same names present in ``zope.configuration`` (e.g. permissions,
and trusted adapters/utilities).

Please see docs/index.rst for the documentation.
