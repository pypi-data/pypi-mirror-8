Description: # Introduction #
        
        A python plugin for integrating collectd and transmission. With this
        installed, collectd will be querying transmission for the following:
        
        * downloadedBytes
        * uploadedBytes
        * filesAdded
        * secondsActive
        * activeTorrentCount
        * blocklist\_size
        * downloadSpeed
        * uploadSpeed
        * pausedTorrentCount
        * torrentCount
        
        and creating the relevant RRD files (or pushing to graphite or you have
        collectd doing)
        
        # How to use #
        I assume a Debian system here, amend accordingly for your system
        
        If you have not already installed transmision, install it:
        
            apt-get install transmission-daemon
        
        The above install the daemon cause a headless box is assumed. It should
        probably work with a non headless box as well and a normal transmission
        installation but this has not been tested.
        
        Install the python transmission binding
        
            apt-get install python-transmissionrpc
        
        Install collectd.
        
            apt-get install collectd
        
        Clone the repo, copy the .py, do whatever you want so that the .py file
        ends up somewhere in your fileystem
        
        Insert the following in your collectd.conf
        
            <Plugin python>
                ModulePath "/path/to/module/dir"
                LogTraces false
                Interactive false
                Import "transmission_stats"
                <Module transmission_stats>
                    username "myuser" # Required
                    password "mypass" # Required
                    hostname "http://localhost:9091/transmission/rpc" # Optional, default to what we got here
                    timeout "5" # Optional, defaults to 5
                </Module>
            </Plugin>
        
        modified accordingly to your needs. Restart collectd and you are done.
        
            sudo service collectd restart
        
        There should be rrds for transmission under collectd's data directory.
        Most probably that is /var/lib/collectd/rrd/_hostname_/transmission/
        
        ## How to display your data ##
        
        Well if you got collectd, you probably already have a way of displaying
        your data anyway. If you don't there are various frontends available at:
        
        [https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/List\_of\_front-ends](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/List\_of\_front-ends)
        
        # Compatibility #
        
        Developed and tested on Debian Wheezy system. Feel free to submit PRs for other systems support
