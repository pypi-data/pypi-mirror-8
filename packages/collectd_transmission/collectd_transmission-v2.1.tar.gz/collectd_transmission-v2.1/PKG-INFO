Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A python plugin for integrating collectd and transmission. With this
        installed, collectd will be querying transmission for the following:
        
        Per session and cumulative:
        
        * downloadedBytes
        * uploadedBytes
        * filesAdded
        * secondsActive
        
        General:
        
        * activeTorrentCount
        * blocklist\_size
        * downloadSpeed
        * uploadSpeed
        * pausedTorrentCount
        * torrentCount
        
        and creating the relevant RRD files (or pushing to graphite or whatever
        you have collectd doing)
        
        Some of these metrics are per session, some session cumulative, some are
        session independent. Their type 'current', 'cumulative', 'general' is set
        in the name of the metric
        
        Quick Installation
        ==================
        
        Debian/Ubuntu assumed. Prereqs installation
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            apt-get install collectd transmission-daemon python-transmissionrpc python-pip
        
        
        And then the actually software
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install collectd_transmission
        
        Configure
        =========
        
        Insert the following in your collectd.conf::
        
            <Plugin python>
                LogTraces false
                Interactive false
                Import "collectd_transmission"
                <Module collectd_transmission>
                    username "myuser" # Required
                    password "mypass" # Required
                </Module>
            </Plugin>
        
        modified accordingly to your needs. Restart collectd and you are done.
        
        There should be rrds for transmission under collectd's data directory.
        Most probably that is /var/lib/collectd/rrd/<hostname>/transmission/
