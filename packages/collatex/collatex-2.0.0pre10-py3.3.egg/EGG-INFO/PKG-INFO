        CollateX is a software to
        
        - read multiple (â‰¥ 2) versions of a text, splitting each version into parts (tokens) to be compared,
        - identify similarities of and differences between the versions (including moved/transposed segments) by aligning tokens, and
        - output the alignment results in a variety of formats for further processing, for instance to support the production of a critical apparatus or the stemmatical analysis of a text's genesis.

        * Documentation: http://collatex.rtfd.org.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Non progressive multiple sequence alignment
        * Multiple output formats: alignment table, variant graph
        * Near matching (optional)
        * Supports Python 3
        * Supports unicode (Python 3 only)
        
        
        How to install:
        ---------------
        
        Mac/Linux:
        sudo pip3 install --pre collatex
        
        if you don't have pip installed, install it first with:
        sudo easy_install3 pip
        
        For near matching functionality python-levenshtein C library is required.
        
        Install it with (on Mac OS X and Linux):
        
        sudo pip3 install python-levenshtein
        
        Windows users need a precompiled binary distribution of this library if they want to use near matching.
        
        
        Simple example:
        ---------------
        ::
        
          from collatex import *
        
          collation = Collation()
          collation.add_witness("A", "The quick brown fox jumps over the dog.")
          collation.add_witness("B", "The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
        
          alignment_table = collate(collation)
        
        Add
        ::
        
          print(alignment_table)
        	
        to show the results.
        
        When running from the command shell run the example script with:
        ::
        
        	python ./nameofscript.py

         to determine whether you are running an environment that is capable of display HTML or SVG. 
        
        2.0.0pre9 (2014-10-02)
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Added near matching option to collate function.
        * Added variant or invariant status to columns in alignment table object and JSON output.
        * Added experimental A* decision graph search optimization.  
        
        2.0.0pre8 (2014-09-18)
        ++++++++++++++++++++++

        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Added JSON output to collate method.
        * Added option to collate method to enable or disable parallel segmentation.
        * Added table output to collate_pretokenized_json method, next to the already existing JSON output.
        * Cached the suffix and LCP arrays to prevent unnecessary recalculation
        * Fixed handling of empty cells in JSON output of pretokenized JSON.
        * Fixed compatibility issue when rendering HTML or SVG with IPython 2.1 instead of IPython 0.13.
        * Corrected RST syntax in package info description.
