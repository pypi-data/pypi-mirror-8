        CollateX is a software to
        
        - read multiple (≥ 2) versions of a text, splitting each version into parts (tokens) to be compared,
        - identify similarities of and differences between the versions (including moved/transposed segments) by aligning tokens, and
        - output the alignment results in a variety of formats for further processing, for instance to support the production of a critical apparatus or the stemmatical analysis of a text's genesis.

        * Documentation: http://collatex.rtfd.org.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Non progressive multiple sequence alignment
        * Multiple output formats: alignment table, variant graph
        * Near matching (optional)
        * Supports Python 3
        * Supports unicode (Python 3 only)
        
        
        How to install:
        ---------------
        
        Mac/Linux:
        sudo pip3 install --pre collatex
        
        if you don't have pip installed, install it first with:
        sudo easy_install3 pip
        
        For near matching functionality python-levenshtein C library is required.
        
        Install it with (on Mac OS X and Linux):
        
        sudo pip3 install python-levenshtein
        
        Windows users need a precompiled binary distribution of this library if they want to use near matching.
        
        
        Simple example:
        ---------------
        ::
        
          from collatex import *
        
          collation = Collation()
          collation.add_plain_witness("A", "The quick brown fox jumps over the dog.")
          collation.add_plain_witness("B", "The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
        
          alignment_table = collate(collation)
        
        Add
        ::
        
          print(alignment_table)
        	
        to show the results.
        
        When running from the command shell run the example script with:
        ::
        
        	python3 ./nameofscript.py

        2.0.0pre11 (2014-12-02)
        +++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Bug-fix: collate_pretokenize_json function should not re-tokenized the content. Thanks to Tara L. Andrews.
        * Allow near-matching for plain as well as for pre-tokenized content. Thanks to Tara L. Andrews.
        * Added HTML option to collate function for the output as an alignment table represented as HTML.
        
        
        2.0.0pre10 (2014-11-13)
        +++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Added support for Unicode character encoding
        * Ported codebase from Python 2 to Python 3
        * Separated IPython display logic from functional logic. No longer will the collate function try to determine whether you are running an environment that is capable of display HTML or SVG. 
        
        2.0.0pre9 (2014-10-02)
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Added near matching option to collate function.
        * Added variant or invariant status to columns in alignment table object and JSON output.
        * Added experimental A* decision graph search optimization.  
        
        2.0.0pre8 (2014-09-18)
        ++++++++++++++++++++++

        * Combined suffix array and edit graph aligner approaches into one collation algorithm.
        
        2.0.0pre7 (2014-07-14)

        * Added JSON output to collate method.
        * Added option to collate method to enable or disable parallel segmentation.
        * Added table output to collate_pretokenized_json method, next to the already existing JSON output.
        * Cached the suffix and LCP arrays to prevent unnecessary recalculation
        * Fixed handling of empty cells in JSON output of pretokenized JSON.
        * Fixed compatibility issue when rendering HTML or SVG with IPython 2.1 instead of IPython 0.13.
        * Corrected RST syntax in package info description. 
        
        2.0.0pre4 (2014-06-11)

        * Fixed imports in init.py, "from collatex import \*" now works correctly.
        * Added IPython HTML support for alignment table.
        * Added IPython SVG support for variant graph.
        * Added convenience constructors on Collation object.
