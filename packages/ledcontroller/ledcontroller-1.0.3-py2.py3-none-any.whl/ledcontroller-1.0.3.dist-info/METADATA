Wi-Fi LED controller
====================

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/ojarva/python-ledcontroller.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/ojarva/python-ledcontroller



Controller for LimitlessLED RGBW lights (should be compatible with easybulb/milight as well).

Installation
------------

::

  pip install ledcontroller

Usage
-----

::

  import ledcontroller
  led = ledcontroller.LedController("192.168.1.6")
  led.on()
  led.set_color("red", 1)
  led.white(2)
  led.set_brightness(50, 2)
  led.disco(3)
  led.disco_faster(3)
  led.off(4)

Notes
-----

- There is automatic 100ms pause between each command. Almost every action requires sending more than one command, thus requiring several hundred milliseconds. You can change this with keyword argument "pause_between_commands". However, decreasing the delay will cause some commands to fail.
- As the gateway seems to be rather unreliable, all commands are sent multiple times (three by default). If you want to change this, use "LedController(ip, repeat_commands=n)" to create new lightcontroller object.
- If for some reason you need to change gateway port, use keyword port= to change it.
- Run testsuite with "python setup.py test". Tests only run the code without checking whether proper commands were sent.
