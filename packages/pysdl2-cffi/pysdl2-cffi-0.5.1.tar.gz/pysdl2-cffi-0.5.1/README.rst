pysdl2-cffi is a Python wrapper for SDL2 written using cffi, featuring:

- A cffi + dlopen interface to the underlying SDL2 libraries.
- Automatically generated, consistent helper functions for SDL2, SDL_image,
  SDL_mixer, and SDL_ttf that hide most allocation and dereferencing.
- Useful docstrings on every function, including the C function signature and
  (for SDL2 only) the library's original doxygen documentation reformatted as
  Sphinx restructured text.
- A small collection of libSDL2's original example / test programs converted
  to Python using Eric S. Raymond's ctopy.

The goal is to provide a flat, consistent, faithful-to-C binding with some
more-Pythonic renaming and conveniences.

This wrapper won't contain anything that doesn't directly translate to part of
the library's API. The goal is to be a dependency for something like pygame,
not a replacement.

This library is developed on Linux and OS X; not yet tested on Windows.

This library is licensed under the GPLv2 or (at your option) any later
version.
