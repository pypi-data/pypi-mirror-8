Description: lda: Topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation
        ====================================================

        ``lda`` implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) using collapsed Gibbs
        sampling. ``lda`` is fast and is tested on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you have NumPy installed,
        
        ``pip install lda``
        
        Installation does not require a compiler on Windows or OS X.
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        ``lda.LDA`` implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The interface follows
        conventions found in scikit-learn_.
        
        The following demonstrates how to inspect a model of a subset of the Reuters
        news dataset. The input below, ``X``, is a document-term matrix (sparse matrices
        are accepted).
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> import lda
            >>> import lda.datasets
            >>> X = lda.datasets.load_reuters()
            >>> vocab = lda.datasets.load_reuters_vocab()
            >>> titles = lda.datasets.load_reuters_titles()
            >>> X.shape
            (395, 4258)
            >>> model = lda.LDA(n_topics=20, n_iter=500, random_state=1)
            >>> model.fit(X)  # model.fit_transform(X) is also available
            >>> topic_word = model.topic_word_  # model.components_ also works
            >>> n_top_words = 8
            >>> for i, topic_dist in enumerate(topic_word):
            ...     topic_words = np.array(vocab)[np.argsort(topic_dist)][:-n_top_words:-1]
            ...     print('Topic {}: {}'.format(i, ' '.join(topic_words)))
            Topic 0: church people told years last year time
            Topic 1: elvis music fans york show concert king
            Topic 2: pope trip mass vatican poland health john
            Topic 3: film french against france festival magazine quebec
            Topic 4: king michael romania president first service romanian
            Topic 5: police family versace miami cunanan west home
            Topic 6: germany german war political government minister nazi
            Topic 7: harriman u.s clinton churchill ambassador paris british
            Topic 8: yeltsin russian russia president kremlin moscow operation
            Topic 9: prince queen bowles church king royal public
            Topic 10: simpson million years south irish churches says
            Topic 11: charles diana parker camilla marriage family royal
            Topic 12: east peace prize president award catholic timor
            Topic 13: order nuns india successor election roman sister
            Topic 14: pope vatican hospital surgery rome roman doctors
            Topic 15: mother teresa heart calcutta missionaries hospital charity
            Topic 16: bernardin cardinal cancer church life catholic chicago
            Topic 17: died funeral church city death buddhist israel
            Topic 18: museum kennedy cultural city culture greek byzantine
            Topic 19: art exhibition century city tour works madonna
        
        The document-topic distributions are available in ``model.doc_topic_``.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> doc_topic = model.doc_topic_
            >>> for i in range(10):
            ...     print("{} (top topic: {})".format(titles[i], doc_topic[i].argmax()))

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+ is required. The following packages are required
        
        - numpy_
        - pbr_
        
        Caveat
        ------
        
        ``lda`` aims for simplicity. (It happens to be fast, as essential parts are
        written in C via Cython_.) If you are working with a very large corpus you may
        wish to use more sophisticated topic models such as those implemented in hca_
        and MALLET_.  hca_ is written entirely in C and MALLET_ is written in Java.
        Unlike ``lda``, hca_ can use more than one processor at a time. Both MALLET_ and
        hca_ implement topic models known to be more robust than standard latent
        Dirichlet allocation.
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        Latent Dirichlet allocation is described in `Blei et al. (2003)`_ and `Pritchard
        et al. (2000)`_. Inference using collapsed Gibbs sampling is described in
        `Griffiths and Steyvers (2004)`_.
