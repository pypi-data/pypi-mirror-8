        Life, the Universe, and Everything
        ==================================
        
        A liveblog is a blog post which is intended to provide a rolling textual coverage of an ongoing event.
        
        A liveblog is continuously updated with timestamped micro-updates which are placed above previous micro-updates.
        
        Typical use case is the following:
        
        - The publisher of a news site creates a liveblog
        - Editors add micro-updates to the liveblog as the event goes on
        - Visitors of the site on the liveblog get micro-updates automatically via AJAX calls
        
        Mostly Harmless

        Todo list
        ---------
        
        - Use fuzzy dates
        - Prettify the prepend of micro-updates
        - Do not load all micro-updates by default as the page could grow huge and implement infinite scrolling
        - Make it responsive

        Don't Panic
        ===========
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.liveblog
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.liveblog`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        .. Note::
            You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After installing the package you will see a new content type available: Liveblog.
        
        A liveblog has a title, a description and an image field.
        The image field is used to set up a header on the liveblog.

            :height: 440px
            :width: 640px
        
        Before feeding the liveblog with micro-updates you will need to activate it.
        Now, go to the Update tab and start writing micro-updates.
        
        A micro-update is basically a text that should optionally have a title.
        The date and time of the micro-update is automatically recorded for you.
        After publishing a micro-update you will see it on top of your liveblog before all previous micro-updates.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liveblog/master/create-microupdate.png
            :align: center
            :height: 580px
            :width: 640px
        
        All people viewing your liveblog will receive automatic updates every minute.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liveblog/master/anonymous-view.png
            :align: center
            :height: 560px
            :width: 640px
        
        Many editors can update the liveblog safely.
        When another editor adds a micro-update you will see it automatically on your screen even if you are writing a new one.
        
        You can delete micro-updates also.
        This will trigger a complete page refresh on all current viewers to avoid the displaying of invalid content in your liveblog.
        The page refresh will happen withing the next minute.
        If another editor deletes a micro-update you will see a message on your screen but no content refresh will take place.
        This way we avoid interrupting editors from their work.

            :align: center
            :height: 500px
            :width: 640px
        
        When a liveblog is not going to be updated anymore you should deactivate it.
        
        Workflow
        --------
        
        The package defines a workflow to be used with the content type (Liveblog Workflow).
        
        The workflow defines 3 states: private, active and inactive.
        Liveblogs are created in the private state.
        When activated, the liveblog will be published and automatic refresh of micro-updates will be enabled.
        When deactivated, the liveblog will remain public, but automatic refresh of micro-updates will be disabled.
        No micro-updates can be added to a liveblog in inactive state.
        To continue adding micro-updates, just activate the liveblog again.
        
        How does it work
        ----------------
        
        TBD.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b2 (2014-09-13)
        ------------------
        
        - An adapter listing the URLs to be purged when a Liveblog is modified was added.
          [ericof]
        
        - Refactor ``recent-updates`` view to get rid of the timestamp parameter.
          This way we avoid a potential source of DoS attacks.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.0b1 (2014-09-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Timestamp handling was simplified.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Implement the ``Expires`` header on ``recent-updates`` view.
          This will help us control better how long the page is going to live.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Add a workflow specific to liveblogs.
          The workflow defines 3 states: private, active and inactive.
          This way we can control when automatic refresh of micro-updates happens.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Refresh the whole view when a micro-update has been deleted to avoid displaying invalid content.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - The header viewlet was including the ``html`` and ``body`` tags on rendering.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Lack of ``id`` attribute on field ``text`` was preventing TinyMCE editor from loading on Plone 4.2.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fire ``ObjectModifiedEvent`` event on micro-updates deletion to invalidate caching on views.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Implement handling of ``If-Modified-Since`` request header on ``recent-updates`` view.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Markup of time tag used on automatic updates was fixed.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.0a1 (2014-09-01)
        ------------------
