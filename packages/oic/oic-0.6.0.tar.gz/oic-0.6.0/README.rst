A complete OpenID Connect implementation
========================================

This will eventually be a complete implementation of OpenID Connect.
And as a side effect a fairly complete implementation of OAuth2.0 .

But while the standards are in the flux they are, the best I can do is
to track them as close as possible.

Expect a certain time-laps between changes of the documents and the
corresponding change of the code. I will strive to keep the time lap as
short as possible.
