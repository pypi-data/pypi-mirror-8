Description: ==========================
         ftw.recipe.checkversions
        ==========================
        
        The ``ftw.recipe.checkversions`` buildout recipe helps you finding newer versions
        of your dependency packages.
        It does this based on your version pinnings (buildout config file) by checking the
        current releases of each package on pypi.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Buildout example:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            parts = checkversions
        
            [checkversions]
            recipe = ftw.recipe.checkversions
            versions = versions.cfg
            blacklists =
                http://dist.plone.org/release/4-latest/versions.cfg
                https://raw.github.com/4teamwork/ftw-buildouts/master/test-versions.cfg
            blacklist-packages =
                zope.interface
        
        
        **versions**
          A file path or URL to a buildout config file containing version pinnings.
          The list of packages and the current pinnings are retreived from this file
          from the ``[versions]`` section.
        
        **blacklists**
          A list of file paths and / or URLs of buildout configuration files containing
          version pinnings of packages to be ignored.
          All packages in the ``[versions]`` section are ignored, regardless of their pinning.
        
        **blacklist-packages**
          List package names to be blacklisted.
        
        **index**
          Custom pypi index URL, e.g. ``http://custom.pypi/simple``
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        After installing the recipe using buildout simply run the ``bin/checkversions`` script.
        The script prints out new versions of packages which are not listed in a blacklist.
        Packages which are already up to date are not listed at all.
        
        
        Similar packages
        ================
        
        - `z3c.checkversions <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.checkversions>`_ does a similar job,
          but it does some things differently, such as the blacklisting strategy.
