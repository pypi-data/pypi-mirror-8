        IndieAuth
        =========
        discoverAuthEndpoints()
        -----------------------
        Find the authorization or redirect_uri endpoints for the given authDomain.
        
        validateAuthCode()
        ------------------
        Call authorization endpoint to validate given auth code.
        
        Requires
        ========
        Python v2.6+ but see requirements.txt for a full list
        
        Installing the latest version of Requests and it's OAuth plugin now requires
        pyOpenSSL which will require compiling of source libs. You may need to have
        installed the -dev package for the version of Python you are working with.
        
        For testing we use [httmock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/httmock/) to mock
        the web calls.
