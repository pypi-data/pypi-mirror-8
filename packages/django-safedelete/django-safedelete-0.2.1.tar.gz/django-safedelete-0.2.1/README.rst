What is it ?
------------

For various reasons, you may want to avoid deleting objects from your database.

This Django application provides a model mixin, that allows you to transparently retrieve or delete your objects,
without having them deleted from your database.

You can choose what happens when you delete an object :
 - it can be masked from your database (soft delete)
 - it can be normally deleted (hard delete)
 - it can be hard-deleted, but if its deletion would delete other objects, it will only be masked


Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    # Models

    # We create a new mixin, with the given policy : Objects will be hard-deleted, or soft deleted if other objects would have been deleted too.
    SafeDeleteMixin = safedelete_mixin_factory(HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE)

    class Article(SafeDeleteMixin):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Order(SafeDeleteMixin):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        articles = models.ManyToManyField(Article)


    # Example of use

    >>> article1 = Article(name='article1')
    >>> article1.save()

    >>> article2 = Article(name='article2')
    >>> article2.save()

    >>> order = Order(name='order')
    >>> order.save()
    >>> order.articles.add(article1)

    # This article will be masked, but not deleted from the database as it is still referenced in an order.
    >>> article1.delete()

    # This article will be deleted from the database.
    >>> article2.delete()
