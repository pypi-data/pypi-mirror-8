spambayes-lite
==============

This is an attempt to clean up and reuse `SpamBayes <http://spambayes.sourceforge.net>`_ as a pure library. On top of the existing features already present in SpamBayes the following is currently implemented:

* MongoDB storage backend
* Move to dnspython instead of pydns

Make sure you check the TODO for planned changes before you replace SpamBayes with this as ALL UI-code will be removed eventually.

See http://spambayes.sourceforge.net for more on SpamBayes.
