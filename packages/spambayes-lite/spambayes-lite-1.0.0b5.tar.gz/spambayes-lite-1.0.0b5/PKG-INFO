Description: ==============
        spambayes-lite
        ==============
        
        This is an attempt to clean up and reuse `SpamBayes <http://spambayes.sourceforge.net>`_ as a pure library. On top of the existing features already present in SpamBayes the following is currently implemented:
        
        * MongoDB storage backend
        * Move to dnspython instead of pydns
        
        Make sure you check the TODO for planned changes before you replace SpamBayes with this as ALL UI-code will be removed eventually.
        
        See http://spambayes.sourceforge.net for more on SpamBayes.
