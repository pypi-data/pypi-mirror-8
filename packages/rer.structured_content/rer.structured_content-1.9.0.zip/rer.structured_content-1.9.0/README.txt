Inside a Structured Document you can add folder structure called **Folder Deepening**. This kind on
folders (and content inside) are used in a different way.

For every Folder Deepening, the document view will display a navigation-portlet-like structure.

Contents inside the Folder Deepening (and folders itself) are sensible to "Omit from navigation"
option.

Other contents and other folders
--------------------------------

Other contents and folder inside the Structured Document are not show directly in the document view,
so you must link them yourself.

The default view itself can different for every installation. Just change the
