Description: RER Structured Content
        ======================
        
        This product will add to your Plone site a new content type: the **Structured Document**.
        
        This want to be a not-so-more-complex alternative to Plone *Page* content. Features are similar, but you
        can add attachments and subdocuments inside the content itself.
        
        This is the way used also in other products like `RichDocument`__ and `PloneArticle`__.

        Additional features
        -------------------
        
        Inside a Structured Document you can add folder structure called **Folder Deepening**. This kind on
        folders (and content inside) are used in a different way.
        
        For every Folder Deepening, the document view will display a navigation-portlet-like structure.
        
        Contents inside the Folder Deepening (and folders itself) are sensible to "Omit from navigation"
        option.
        
        Other contents and other folders
        --------------------------------
        
        Other contents and folder inside the Structured Document are not show directly in the document view,
        so you must link them yourself.
        
        Document views
        --------------
        
        You can choose from two view for Structured Document.
        The default view itself can different for every installation. Just change the
        *structured_document_view* inside the *rer_properties* sheet in *portal_properties* (through ZMI access).
