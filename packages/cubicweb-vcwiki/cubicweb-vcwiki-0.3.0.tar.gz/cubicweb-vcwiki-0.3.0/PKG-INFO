        =============
        
        
        Summary
        -------
        
        This is a version controlled wiki component for the CubicWeb framework.
        
        It uses Mercurial_ as a content storage and can be edited both with your
        favorite editor and the web GUI.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        The wiki web GUI usage should be pretty straightforward. It can be used to:
        
        * create a page in the wiki from a yet unknown wiki's sub-page URL
        
        * edit an existing page with an optional commit message
        
        * see a page's history and compare versions
        
        * revert a page to a previous version.
        
        `ReStructured Text`_ (ReST) formatted wikis benefit from CubicWeb's powerful
        ReST directives that make it easy to query the database and display the
        resultset in a view (e.g. `eid`, `rql`, `rql-table`).
        
        Present cube also adds a `wiki` directive, which can be used as in following
        example content::
        
            This is a **formatted page content** with a link to
            :wiki:`subdirectory/page`.
        
            This displays a "subdirectory/page" text in the page, that links to URL
            <current-page-url>/subdirectory/page, and which path in the Mercurial
            repository is `<current-page-path>/subdirectory/page.rst`.
            
            You can also specify a link text that is different from the page's URL
            path. The URL path can be specified either from the wiki's root, like
            :wiki:`/subdirectory/other:this one`, or relatively to the current page, like
            :wiki:`current_page_sibling:this other one`.
        
        
        Wiki setup
        ----------
        
        Currently, the easiest way to setup a new wiki is through the command line::
        
            cubicweb-ctl new-vcwiki <instance-name> <wiki-name> <repo-path>
        
        This creates a ReST formatted wiki named *wiki-name* from a pre-existing
        Mercurial repository located at *repo-path* on your disk in a pre-existing
        CubicWeb application instance named *instance-name*.
        
        You will need the admin user login and password to use this.
        
        An alternative is to use the web GUI, but it requires a few steps until now:
        
        1. The administrator must create a `Repository` entity and set its `path`
           attribute to a valid path to a Mercurial repository (which must be created
           beforehand).
        
        2. The administrator must add write permissions for the `Repository`, via
           the `localperms` cube (action available at the left of the screen).
        
        3. The administrator must perform a "Refresh repository" action, also available
           at the left of the screen.
        
        4. Create a `VcWiki` entity and set `rst` as default extension.
        
        5. You should be able to create your wiki homepage through the `wiki homepage`
           action on the left.
        
        Note that the Wiki pages are available at an URL which has the following
        format::
        
            <base-url>/wiki/<wiki-name>/<page-name>
