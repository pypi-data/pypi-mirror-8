pyqode.python uses a couple of external libraries that were really helpful:

    * `jedi`_: code completion, calltips
    * `pep8`_: style checker
    * `frosted`_: syntax checker

Thanks to their developers for their great work!

.. _`jedi`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jedi
.. _`pep8`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8
