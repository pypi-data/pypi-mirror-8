Welcome to Pyblue2
==================

A simple static site generator. Zero configuration. Works with any existing site.

PyBlue allows the reuse of data and visuals (header/footer) across many pages
and it can generate static sites from dynamic templates.

PyBlue also makes it easy to use [Markdown][markdown] inside of  webpages.
