Description: Welcome to Pyblue2
        ==================
        
        A simple static site generator. Zero configuration. Works with any
        existing site.
        
        PyBlue allows the reuse of data and visuals (header/footer) across many
        pages and it can generate static sites from dynamic templates.
        
        PyBlue also makes it easy to use
        `Markdown <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`__ inside of webpages.
        
        This file is located in docs/index.html of the PyBlue distribution.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Install it with ``easy_install pyblue`` or
        ``pip install pyblue --upgrade``
        
        Alternatively download it from the `PyBlue at
        PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/>`__ site.
        
        **Note:** Version 2.0 of pyblue moved from Mako Templates to Django
        Templates and with that introduced other semantic differences. To
        install the last version of the ``1.*`` line use:
        ``easy_install pyblue==1.1.2`` or ``pip install pyblue=1.1.2``. See also
        the docs at: `Pyblue
        1.1.2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/1.1.2>`__
