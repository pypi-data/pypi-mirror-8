    Solves for the bus voltage angles at all but the reference bus, given the
    full system C{B} matrix and the vector of bus real power injections, the
    initial vector of bus voltage angles (in radians), and column vectors with
    the lists of bus indices for the swing bus, PV buses, and PQ buses,
    respectively. Returns a vector of bus voltage angles in radians.
