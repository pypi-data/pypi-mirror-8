v0.3.0, 30/11/2014 -- Port to Python 3.
    core:   'async_subrocess.AsyncPopen', 'file.compare' have a new 'encoding' parameter.
            Added the 'file.open_()' function, which, on Python 2, removes an 'encoding' argument
            before calling 'open()'.
            Added 'path.CurrentDirectory', a context manager to change current directory 
            temporarily.

             authentication.
