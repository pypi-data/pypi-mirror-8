        Checks a JSON file for any duplicate keys, which would be ignored by the normal
        parser.
        
        Inspired by and based off of:
        <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2013-May/647954.html>.
        
        Usage:
        
        * ```jsonchecker file_to_validate.json```
        
        * ```jsonchecker directory/of/json/files/```
        
        The script will exit with a status code of 1 if any duplicate keys are found,
        0 if none are.
