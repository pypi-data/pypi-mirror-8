Description: layered-yaml-attrdict-config (lya)
        ----------------------------------
        
        YAML-based configuration module.
        
        A set of classes I've created over time to make configuration files more
        readable and easier to use in the code.
        
        Basic syntax
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Idea is the same as with ``yaml.safe_load()`` (``yaml.load()`` was used
        before 14.06.5, see #2 for rationale behind the change) to load YAML
        configuration file like this one:
        
        ::
        
            core:
              connection:
                # twisted endpoint syntax, see twisted.internet.endpoints.html#clientFromString
                endpoint: tcp:host=example.com:port=6667
                nickname: testbot
                reconnect:
                  maxDelay: 30
              xattr_emulation: /tmp/xattr.db
        
        But when you use resulting nested-dicts in code, consider the difference
        between ``config['core']['connection']['reconnect']['maxDelay']`` and
        ``config.core.connection.reconnect.maxDelay``.
        
        Python dicts support only the first syntax, this module supports both.
        Assigning values through attributes is also possible.
        
        Recursive updates (inheritance)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        I find it useful to have default parameters specified in the same format
        as any configurable overrides to them - simple yaml file.
        
        So consider this use-case:
        
        ::
        
            import lya
            cfg = lya.AttrDict.from_yaml('default.yaml')
            for path in sys.argv[1:]: cfg.update_yaml(path)
            cfg.dump(sys.stdout)
        
        (there is also ``AttrDict.update_dict`` method for recursive updates
        from dict)
        
        With default configuration file from the previous section shipped along
        with the package as "default.yaml", you can have simple override like:
        
        ::
        
            core:
              connection:
                endpoint: ssl:host=some.local.host:port=6697
        
        And above code will result in the following config (which will be dumped
        as nicely-formatted yaml, as presented below):
        
        ::
        
            core:
              connection:
                endpoint: ssl:host=some.local.host:port=6697
                nickname: testbot
                reconnect:
                  maxDelay: 30
              xattr_emulation: /tmp/xattr.db
        
        Rebase
        ^^^^^^
        
        Similar to the above, but reversed, so result presented above can be
        produced by taking some arbitrary configuration (AttrDict) and rebasing
        it on top of some other (base) config:
        
        ::
        
            import lya
            base = lya.AttrDict.from_yaml('default.yaml')
            for path in sys.argv[1:]:
              cfg.rebase(base)
              print 'Config:', path
              cfg.dump(sys.stdout)
        
        Useful to fill-in default values for similar configuration parts (e.g.
        configuration for each module or component).
        
        Key ordering
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Keys in python dictionaries are unordered and by default, yaml module
        loses any ordering of keys in yaml dicts as well.
        
        Strictly speaking, this is correct processing of YAML, but for most
        cases it is inconvenient when instead of clear section like this one:
        
        ::
        
            processing_order:
              receive_test:
                name: '#bot-central'
                server: testserver
              important_filter: '^important:'
              announce: '#important-news'
              debug_filter: '\(debug message\)'
              feedback: botmaster
        
        ...you have to resort to putting all the keys that need ordering into a
        list just to preserve ordering.
        
        Especially annoying if you have to access these sections by key
        afterwards (and they should be unique) or you need to override some of
        the sections later, so list wrapper becomes completely artificial as it
        have to be converted into OrderedDict anyway.
        
        YAML files, parsed from ``AttrDict.from_yaml`` and
        ``AttrDict.update_yaml`` methods have key ordering preserved, and
        AttrDict objects are based on OrderedDict objects, which provide all the
        features of dict and preserve ordering during the iteration like lists
        do.
        
        There's no downside to it - both ordered dicts and lists can be used as
        usual, if that's more desirable.
        
        Flattening
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Sometimes it's useful to have nested configuration (like presented
        above) to be represented as flat list of key-value pairs.
        
        Example usage can be storage of the configuration tree in a simple k-v
        database (like berkdb) or comparison of configuration objects - ordered
        flat lists can be easily processed by the "diff" command, tested for
        equality or hashed.
        
        That is easy to do via ``AttrDict.flatten`` method, producing (from
        config above) a list like this one:
        
        ::
        
            [ (('core', 'connection', 'endpoint'), 'ssl:host=some.local.host:port=6697'),
              (('core', 'connection', 'nickname'), 'testbot'),
              (('core', 'connection', 'reconnect', 'maxDelay'), 30),
              (('core', 'xattr_emulation'), '/tmp/xattr.db') ]
        
        Resulting list contains 2-value tuples - key tuple, containing the full
        path of the value and the value object itself.
        
        A note on name clashes
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Methods of AttrDict object itself, like ones listed above can clash with
        keys in the config file itself, in which case attribute access to config
        values is not possible, i.e.:
        
        ::
        
            >>> a = lya.AttrDict(keys=1)
            >>> a.keys
            <bound method AttrDict.keys of AttrDict([('keys', 1)])>
            >>> a['keys']
            1
        
        It's kinda-deliberate that such basic methods (like the ones from
        built-in dict and listed above) are accessible by as usual attributes,
        though a bit inconsistent.
        
        With any kind of dynamic keys, just use access by key, not by attr.
        
        More stuff
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Some extra data-mangling methods are available via ``AttrDict._`` proxy
        object (that allows access to all other methods as well, e.g.
        ``a._.pop(k)``).
        
        -  ``AttrDict._.apply(func, items=False, update=True)``
        
           Apply a function (``f(v)`` or ``f(k, v)`` if "items" is set) to all
           values (on any level, depth-first), modifying them in-place if
           "update" is set.
        
        -  ``AttrDict._.apply_flat(func, update=True)``
        
           Same as "apply" above, but passes tuple of keys forming a path to
           each value (e.g. ``('a', 'b', 'c')`` for value in
           ``dict(a=dict(b=dict(c=1)))``) to ``f(k, v)``.
        
        -  ``AttrDict._.filter(func, items=False)``
        
           Same as "apply" above, but will remove values if filter function
           returns falsy value, leaving them unchanged otherwise.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It's a regular package for Python 2.7+ and Python 3.0+.
        
        Using `pip <http://pip-installer.org/>`__ is the best way (see also
        `pip2014 <http://pip2014.com/>`__ basic usage essentials):
        
        ::
        
            % pip install layered-yaml-attrdict-config
        
        If you don't have it, use:
        
        ::
        
            % easy_install pip
            % pip install layered-yaml-attrdict-config
        
        Alternatively (`see
        also <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`__):
        
        ::
        
            % curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python
            % pip install layered-yaml-attrdict-config
        
        Or, if you absolutely must:
        
        ::
        
            % easy_install layered-yaml-attrdict-config
        
        But, you really shouldn't do that.
        
        Current-git version can be installed like this:
        
        ::
        
            % pip install 'git+https://github.com/mk-fg/layered-yaml-attrdict-config.git#egg=layered-yaml-attrdict-config'
        
        Module uses `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/>`__ for processing of the actual
        YAML files, but can work without it, as long as you use any methods with
        "yaml" in their name, i.e. creating and using AttrDict objects like a
        regular dicts.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        ::
        
            import sys, lya
        
            if len(sys.argv) == 1:
              print('Usage: {} [ config.yaml ... ]', file=sys.stderr)
              sys.exit(1)
        
            cfg = lya.AttrDict.from_yaml(sys.argv[1])
            for path in sys.argv[2:]: cfg.update_yaml(path)
        
            cfg.dump(sys.stdout)
