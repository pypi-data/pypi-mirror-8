The `MAP Client`_ is a cross-platform framework for managing workflows. MAP Client is a plugin-based application that can be used to 
create workflows from a collection of workflow steps.  Each workflow step is simply a plugin for the MAP Client which performs some 
basic or even complex task.

One of the central ideas for the MAP Client is to allow users to easily develop and share their own plugins that can be used in a 
workflow.  The requirements for developing a workflow step have been kept as low as practicable thus allowing plugin creators to 
concentrate on the practical implementation of the step rather than conforming to the plugin API.  Additionally the Plugin Wizard tool 
greatly simplifies the first stage in creating a workflow step and generates a considerable amount of the skeleton code required.

Having a plugin based framework makes it possible for groups to share their workflows and workflow steps without requiring a lot of 
extraneous software.  Also having users create and share their plugins increases the flexibility of the MAP Client and distances users 
from relying on an external team of developers.

The MAP Client is an application written in Python and based on Qt the cross-platform application and UI framework.  Further details 
are available in the `documentation`_.
