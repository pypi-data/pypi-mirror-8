Django Newsletter Signup
========================

A reusable Django app, that handles newsletter subscriptions.

Installation
------------

To get the latest stable release from PyPi

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install django-newsletter-signup

To get the latest commit from GitHub

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/bitmazk/django-newsletter-signup.git#egg=newsletter_signup

Add ``newsletter_signup`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'newsletter_signup',
    )

Add the ``newsletter_signup`` URLs to your ``urls.py``

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^newsletter/', include('newsletter_signup.urls')),
    )


Don't forget to migrate your database

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py migrate newsletter_signup


Usage
-----

Just link to the signup page or fetch it's contents via AJAX into e.g. a
bootstrap modal. Once a user fills out the subscription form she gets a
verification email, that on click makes the Subscription verified.

Future updates might include mailchimp integration to have everything setup
right away. For now you then need to gather the emails from the admin or your
own custom management views that you want to send mails to, or alternatively
create a custom management command.

Management Commands
-------------------

check_newsletter_signups
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This command will iterate through all signups and check if there's a user in
the system matching a signup's email. You might want to run this command in a
cron job.

Settings
--------

NEWSLETTER_SIGNUP_FROM_EMAIL
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To set the from email in the mails, you can either specifically set the
``NEWSLETTER_SIGNUP_FROM_EMAIL`` setting or only the ``FROM_EMAIL`` setting,
which it per default falls back to.

..code-block:: python

    NEWSLETTER_SIGNUP_FROM_EMAIL = 'news@example.com'


NEWSLETTER_SIGNUP_SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT and NEWSLETTER_SIGNUP_UNSUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Both of these setting work in the same way as they set the email subject for
the subscripe and unsubscribe email. You can either provide a string or a
callable object receiving the subscription object as a parameter.
See ``models.py`` for details. Alternatively you could overwrite those two
templates ``email/unsubscripe_subject.html`` and
``email/subscripe_subject.html``.

..code-block:: python

    SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT = 'Your subscription to our newsletter!'

    UNSUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT = lambda sub: '{0} was unsubscribed.'.format(
        sub.email)
