Description: 
        A pure python scapegoat splay tree class is provided.  It is
        thoroughly unit tested, passes pylint, and is known
        to run on CPython 2.x, CPython 3.x, Pypy 2.2 and
        Jython 2.7b2.
        
        This scapegoat tree looks like a dictionary that's always
        sorted by key.  It also reorganizes itself on every
        put.
        
        Perhaps the most interesting thing about a scapegoat tree,
        is it is balanced even for ordered keys, without any storage
        overhead (unlike treaps and red-black trees).
