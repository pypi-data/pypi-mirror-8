        PyGTKHelpers is a library to assist the building of PyGTK applications. It is
        intentionally designed to be *non-frameworky*, and blend well with your
        particular style of PyGTK development.
        
        PyGTKHelpers provides a number of widespread features including: View
        delegation, MVC, mixed GtkBuilder/Python views, widget proxying, signal
        auto-connection, object-base lists and trees, a number of helper widgets,
        utility functions for assisting creating new GObject types, unit testing
        helpers and utilities to help debug PyGTK applications.
