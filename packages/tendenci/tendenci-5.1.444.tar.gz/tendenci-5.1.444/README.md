# Tendenci

Tendenci 5.+ is the next iteration of a product started in 2001 and released open source in 2012. It is built specifically for NPOs (Non Profit Organizations.) We started with a focus completely on associations but now being open source GPL it is much broader in scope. 
It is a content management system (CMS) with powerful features for event registration, membership management, donations, payments, email integration and much more.

Tendenci allows membership management organizations to communicate, manage and conduct transactions with web site visitors. Tendenci is easy to use and offers many modules as one customizable software package. The 5.x version is open source and built on Django/Python/Postgres and Ubuntu.

## Developer Installing Tendenci?  

Detailed installation docs at [https://tendenci.readthedocs.org/en/latest/](https://tendenci.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). 
You will need to install the server on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (or later) and Postgres 9.1 (or later.) Cloud hypervisors work fine.

## Humans Looking for a Hosted Solution?  

Not a programmer and you just want to host it somewhere else? You can ask your currentfavorite web developer who you already work with. Or do a free trial on tendenci.com. Cool with us either way. We'll even help them set you up if needed. Geek to Geek.  

## Why Did We Make Tendenci Open Source?  

Tendenci was built by the team at Schipul.com iteratively by releasing the core for event registrations. We listened to our clients and over the last 12+ years it has evolved. From LISTENING.  

Our vision: "Connect and Oragnize the World's People" 
Our mission: "To make Tendenci the number 1 platform for NPOs/NGOs/Arts organizations globally."  

Um... and we can't do that without you and the community. How can your organization help Tendenci? Fork it. Build and extend on it. Deploy it. Translate it. Or simply submit an issue if you find a bug.  
Be part of a global movement to reclaim the NGO online space from proprietary companies holding your data hostage.
