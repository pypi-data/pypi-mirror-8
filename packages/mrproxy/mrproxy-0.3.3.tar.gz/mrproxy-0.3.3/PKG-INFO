        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        mrproxy is a Mediocre Reverse Proxy. Seriously, you should never use
        this for anything other than development needs. I wrote this as a quick
        way to inject headers for authentication outside of production.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install mrproxy
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        Currently the only use for mrproxy is additional headers with a request.
        
        ::
        
            $ mrproxy --header="X-Auth-User: gary"
