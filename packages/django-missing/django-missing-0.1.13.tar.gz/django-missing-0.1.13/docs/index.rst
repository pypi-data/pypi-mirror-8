django-missing's documentation
==============================

This Django application bundles some common and useful features which have
not (yet) found a way into Django itself.

You are invited to contribute your own features so that together we create a
powerful and good library of Django additions. Because sometimes you cannot
imagine an useful feature before somebody shows it to you. So it is useful
to have all of them collected together.
