Description: Soup Storage for PloneFormGen Form Data
        =======================================
        
        This PloneFormGen Storage Adapter saves and index form-data in so called
        ``soup``. A soup is an unstructured flat storage containing records with
        attributes (form-data). Attributes are indexed in an ``repoze.catalog``. Thus
        complex queries on the data are possible.
        
        It ships with an full-featured table view based on ``jquery.datatables``.
        Datatables server-side processing enables to have large datasets processed.
        It provides a search over all columns and by single columns. Each column
        can be sorted.
        
        Additional to the form data userid and timestamp of creations is logged.
        
        A row can be edited. After save modification-timestamp, userid and changed
        fields are logged.
        
        CSV-Export of all data is possible, including creators userid, creation- and
        last-modified-timestamp if selected.

        1.2
        ---
        
        - fixes some problems in form re-edit mechanism. Before this change a form
          lost its data if a user clicked on view tab with edit cookie set already.
          Also re-edit resulted in double entries in some cases. With this change also
          issue #1 was fixed, which was in fact a side effect of the above.
