Somoclu - python interface
================================

Somoclu is a massively parallel implementation of self-organizing maps. It relies on OpenMP for multicore execution, MPI for distributing the workload, and it can be accelerated by CUDA on a GPU cluster. A sparse kernel is also included, which is useful for training maps on vector spaces generated in text mining processes. The topology of the grid is rectangular.

Currently a subset of the C++ version is supported with this package.

Get it now
----------

::
   
    $ sudo pip install somoclu

Build on Mac OS X:
--------------------
Before installing using pip, gcc should be installed first. As of OS X 10.9, gcc is just symlink to clang. To build somoclu and this extension correctly, it is recommended to install gcc using something like:
::
   
    $ brew install gcc48

and set environment using:
::
   
    export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc
    export CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++
    export CPP=/usr/local/bin/cpp
    export LD=/usr/local/bin/gcc
    alias c++=/usr/local/bin/c++
    alias g++=/usr/local/bin/g++	
    alias gcc=/usr/local/bin/gcc
    alias cpp=/usr/local/bin/cpp
    alias ld=/usr/local/bin/gcc
    alias cc=/usr/local/bin/gcc

Then you can
::
   
    $ sudo pip install somoclu

    
Build with CUDA support on Linux:
--------------------------------------
You need to clone this repo or download the latest release tarball, and

::
   
    $ cd src/Python
    $ bash makepy.sh

Then if your CUDA installation is located at /opt/cuda and 64bit, you can do the following to install:

::
   
    $ sudo python2 setup_with_CUDA.py install

Otherwise, you should modify the setup_with_CUDA.py ,
change the path to CUDA installation accordingly:

::
   
   call(["./configure", "--without-mpi","--with-cuda=/opt/cuda/"])

and

::
   
   library_dirs=['/opt/cuda/lib64']

Then run the install command

::
   
    $ sudo python2 setup_with_CUDA.py install

Then you can use the python interface like before, with CUDA support.
