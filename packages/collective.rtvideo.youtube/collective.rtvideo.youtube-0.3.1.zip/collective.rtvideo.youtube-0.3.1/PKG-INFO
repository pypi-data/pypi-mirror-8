        Valid URL formats
        =================
        
        Classic URL is supported::
        
            http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7OLg1AZvr4&...otherparams
        
        Also the shortened version can be used::
        
            http://youtu.be/f7OLg1AZvr4
        
        Autoplay
        --------
        
        You can enabled the YouTube video autoplay in two ways:
        
        * Use the YouTube ``autoplay=1`` parameter in the YouTube video URL
          you are saving in Plone.
          
          This is a permanent autoplay: the editor choose to autoplay the video at every visit
        * Call the RedTurtle video content with the ``autoplay=1`` parameter.
          
          This is a user choice autoplay: who links the Plone content choose to auto
          start it.
        
        In the latter case, some accessibility improvements are added to the page for automatically
        put the focus onto the video and simplify keyboard controls (this works on Internet Explorer
        and Firefox, probably other browsers also but there isn't a common behavior).
