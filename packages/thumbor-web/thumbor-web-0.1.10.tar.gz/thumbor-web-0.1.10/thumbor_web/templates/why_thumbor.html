                        Thumbor allows users to store and load images from anywhere needed. It's really simple to implement a new loader or storage. It comes packaged with file, http, redis and mongo implementations for loaders and storages. Just pick what makes sense for you or implement your own.

                        Thumbor has support for image filters. Filters usually apply some post-processing to the images and they can be chained and applied in order. Thumbor's extensible nature allows you to write your own filters, but it comes with some pre-packaged filters of its own. Brightness, contrast, grayscale, red-eye and blur are a few samples.

                        WebP is a new format for lossy and lossless images that compresses a lot better than jpeg and png. Thumbor allows users to specify that browsers that support WebP automatically get it. This can have a dramatic increase in the performance of your website. Besides WebP, Thumbor also uses some tactics to reduce the file size even further.
