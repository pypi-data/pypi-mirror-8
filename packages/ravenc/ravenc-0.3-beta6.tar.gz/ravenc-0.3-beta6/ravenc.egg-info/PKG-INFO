Description: Ravenc is a tool for copying a single video title from a DVD whilst 
        transcoding it. The purpose of this is to make the video available 
        to devices you may have which do not have a DVD player.
        
        Altenatively you can transcode multimedia files on your filesystem.
        
        Ravenc is designed to work with a clean DVD source like the ones you get 
        on bought DVD disks.
        Ravenc was created because Acidrip is no longer being maintained 
        and I found myself needing a DVD ripper. 
        
        The design of Ravenc was heavily influenced by Acidrip but has now 
        significantly changed.
        Ravenc is, in fact, a simple front-end to avlib/avconv which is 
        itself a front-end to some video encoding and decoding libraries. Everything 
        that Ravenc does can be achieved from the command line, Ravenc just 
        simplifies the process.
