        CHANGES
        *******
        
        0.4 (2014-11-03)
        ================
        
        - Adjust to handle Morepath 0.7 API changes concerning request
          construction.
        
        0.3 (2014-09-08)
        ================
        
        - The 0.2 introduced a ``component`` method to obtain a component object
          and thus its URL. This didn't turn out to be compatible with local
          components, so I've changed it to ``get_component`` instead::
        
            request.static_components.get_component('jquery').url()
        
        - Depend on version 0.4 of BowerStatic.
        
        0.2 (2014-08-28)
        ================
        
        - Make available a ``static_components`` property on the request,
          which is a BowerStatic static components object. You can use
          this primarily to get the URL to a component, like this::
        
            request.static_components.component('jquery').url()
        
        - Depend on version 0.3 of BowerStatic.
        
        0.1 (2014-07-07)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release.
