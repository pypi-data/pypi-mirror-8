""" Correlated gaussian random variables.
    
Objects of type :class:`gvar.GVar` represent gaussian random variables,
which are specified by a mean and standard deviation. They are created
using :func:`gvar.gvar`: for example, ::
    
    >>> x = gvar.gvar(0,3)          # 0 +- 3
    >>> y = gvar.gvar(2,4)          # 2 +- 4
    >>> z = x+y                     # 2 +- 5
    >>> print(z)
    2 +- 5
    >>> print(z.mean)
    2.0
    >>> print(z.sdev)
    5.0
    
This module contains tools for creating and manipulating gaussian random
variables including:
    
    - ``mean(g)`` --- extract means.
    
    - ``sdev(g)`` --- extract standard deviations.
    
    - ``var(g)`` --- extract variances.

    - ``chi2(g1, g2)`` --- ``chi**2`` of ``g1-g2``.
    
    - ``evalcov(g)`` --- compute covariance matrix.

    - ``evalcorr(g)`` --- compute correlation matrix.
    
    - ``fmt_values(g)`` --- create table of values for printing.
    
    - ``fmt_errorbudget(g)`` --- create error-budget table for printing.

    - ``fmt_chi2(f)`` --- format chi**2 information in f as string for printing.
    
    - class ``BufferDict`` --- ordered dictionary with data buffer.

    - ``dump(g, outputfile)`` --- pickle a collection of |GVar|\s in file.

    - ``dumps(g)`` --- pickle a collection of |GVar|s in a string.

    - ``load(inputfile)`` --- reconstitute a collection of |GVar|\s from a file.

    - ``loads(inputstr)`` --- reconstitute a collection of |GVar|\s from a string.
    
    - ``raniter(g,N)`` --- iterator for random numbers.
    
    - ``bootstrap_iter(g,N)`` --- bootstrap iterator.
    
    - ``svd(g)`` --- SVD modification of correlation matrix.
    
    - ``dataset.bin_data(data)`` --- bin random sample data.
    
    - ``dataset.avg_data(data)`` --- estimate means of random sample data.
    
    - ``dataset.bootstrap_iter(data,N)`` --- bootstrap random sample data.
    
    - class ``dataset.Dataset`` --- class for collecting random sample data.

There are also sub-modules that implement some standard numerical analysis 
tools for use with |GVar|\s (or ``float``\s):

    - ``cspline`` --- cubic splines for 1-d data

    - ``ode`` --- integration of systems of ordinary differential equations

    - ``powerseries`` --- power series representation of functions

def chi2(g1, g2=None, svdcut=1e-15, nocorr=False, fmt=False):

    ``chi**2`` is a measure of whether the multi-dimensional 
    Gaussian distributions ``g1`` and ``g2`` (dictionaries or arrays) 
    agree with each other --- that is, do their means agree 
    within errors for corresponding elements. The probability is high 
    if ``chi2(g1,g2)/chi2.dof`` is of order 1 or smaller.

    Usually ``g1`` and ``g2`` are dictionaries with the same keys,
    where ``g1[k]`` and ``g2[k]`` are |GVar|\s or arrays of 
    |GVar|\s having the same shape. Alternatively ``g1`` and ``g2``
    can be |GVar|\s, or arrays of |GVar|\s having the same shape. 
    
    One of ``g1`` or ``g2`` can contain numbers instead of |GVar|\s,
    in which case ``chi**2`` is a measure of the likelihood that 
    the numbers came from the distribution specified by the other 
    argument. 

    One or the other of ``g1`` or ``g2`` can be missing keys, or missing
    elements from arrays. Only the parts of ``g1`` and ``g2`` that 
    overlap are used. Also setting ``g2=None`` is equivalent to replacing its 
    elements by zeros.

    ``chi**2`` is computed from the inverse of the covariance matrix
    of ``g1-g2``. The matrix inversion can be sensitive to roundoff 
    errors. In such cases, SVD cuts can be applied by setting
    parameters ``svdcut``; see the documentation 
    for :func:`gvar.svd`, which is used to apply the cut.

    The return value is the ``chi**2``. Extra data is stored in 
    ``chi2`` itself:

    .. attribute:: chi2.dof

        Number of degrees of freedom (that is, the number of variables
        compared).

    .. attribute:: chi2.Q

        The probability that the ``chi**2`` could have been larger, 
        by chance, even if ``g1`` and ``g2`` agree. 
        Values smaller than 0.1 or so suggest that they do not
        agree. Also called the *p-value*.

    If argument ``fmt==True``, then a string is returned containing the
    ``chi**2`` per degree of freedom, the number of degrees of freedom, and
    ``Q``.

def svd(g, svdcut=1e-15, wgts=False):
    """ Apply svd cuts to collection of |GVar|\s in ``g``. 
        
    Standard usage is, for example, ::

        svdcut = ...
        gmod = svd(g, svdcut=svdcut)

    where ``g`` is an array of |GVar|\s or a dictionary containing |GVar|\s
    and/or arrays of |GVar|\s. When ``svdcut>0``, ``gmod`` is 
    a copy of ``g`` whose |GVar|\s have been modified to make 
    their correlation matrix less singular than that of the 
    original ``g``: each eigenvalue ``eig`` of the correlation matrix is 
    replaced by ``max(eig, svdcut * max_eig)`` where ``max_eig`` is 
    the largest eigenvalue. This SVD cut, which is applied separately
    to each block-diagonal sub-matrix of the correlation matrix, 
    increases the variance of the eigenmodes with eigenvalues smaller
    than ``svdcut * max_eig``.

    When ``svdcut`` is negative, eigenmodes of the correlation matrix
    whose eigenvalues are smaller than ``|svdcut| * max_eig`` are dropped
    from the new matrix and the corresponding components of ``g`` are 
    zeroed out (that is, replaced by 0(0)) in ``gmod``.

    There is an additional parameter ``wgts`` in :func:`gvar.svd` whose
    default value is ``False``. Setting ``wgts=1`` or ``wgts=-1`` instead
    causes :func:`gvar.svd` to return a tuple ``(gmod, i_wgts)`` where
    ``gmod``  is the modified copy of ``g``, and ``i_wgts`` contains a
    spectral  decomposition of the covariance matrix corresponding to
    the  modified correlation matrix if ``wgts=1``, or a decomposition of its
    inverse if ``wgts=-1``. The first entry ``i, wgts = i_wgts[0]``  specifies
    the diagonal part of the matrix: ``i`` is a list of the indices in 
    ``gmod.flat`` corresponding to diagonal elements, and ``wgts ** 2`` 
    gives the corresponding matrix elements. The second and subsequent 
    entries, ``i, wgts = i_wgts[n]`` for ``n > 0``, each correspond
    to block-diagonal sub-matrices, where ``i`` is the list of
    indices corresponding to the block, and ``wgts[j]`` are eigenvectors of
    the sub-matrix rescaled so that ::

        numpy.sum(numpy.outer(wi, wi) for wi in wgts[j]

    is the sub-matrix (``wgts=1``) or its inverse (``wgts=-1``).

    To compute the inverse of the covariance matrix from ``i_wgts``, 
    for example, one could use code like::

        gmod, i_wgts = svd(g, svdcut=svdcut, wgts=-1)

        inv_cov = numpy.zeros((n, n), float)
        i, wgts = i_wgts[0]                       # 1x1 sub-matrices
        if len(i) > 0:
            inv_cov[i, i] = numpy.array(wgts) ** 2
        for i, wgts in i_wgts[1:]:                # nxn sub-matrices (n>1)
            for w in wgts:
                inv_cov[i, i[:, None]] += numpy.outer(w, w)

    This sets ``inv_cov`` equal to the inverse of the covariance matrix of 
    the ``gmod``\s. Similarly, we can  compute the expectation value, 
    ``u.dot(inv_cov.dot(v))``, between two vectors (:mod:`numpy` arrays) using::

        result = 0.0
        i, wgts = i_wgts[0]                       # 1x1 sub-matrices 
        if len(i) > 0:
            result += numpy.sum((u[i] * wgts) * (v[i] * wgts))
        for i, wgts in i_wgts[1:]:                # nxn sub-matrices (n>1)
            result += numpy.sum(wgts.dot(u[i]) * wgts.dot(v[i]))

    where ``result`` is the desired expectation value. 
        
    The input parameters are :
        
    :param g: An array of |GVar|\s or a dicitionary whose values are 
        |GVar|\s and/or arrays of |GVar|\s.
    :param svdcut: If positive, replace eigenvalues ``eig`` of the correlation
        matrix with ``max(eig, svdcut * max_eig)`` where ``max_eig`` is
        the largest eigenvalue; if negative, 
        discard eigenmodes with eigenvalues smaller 
        than ``|svdcut| * max_eig``. Default is 1e-15.
    :type svdcut: ``None`` or number ``(|svdcut|<=1)``.
    :param wgts: Setting ``wgts=1`` causes :func:`gvar.svd` to compute 
        and return a spectral decomposition of the covariance matrix of 
        the modified |GVar|\s, ``gmod``. Setting ``wgts=-1`` results in 
        a decomposition of the inverse of the covariance matrix. The
        default value is ``False``, in which case only ``gmod`` is returned.
    :returns: A copy ``gmod`` of ``g`` whose correlation matrix is modified by 
        *svd* cuts. If ``wgts`` is not ``False``,
        a tuple ``(g, i_wgts)`` is returned where ``i_wgts`` 
        contains a spectral decomposition of ``gmod``'s 
        covariance matrix or its inverse.
