   :synopsis: Nonlinear least squares fitting.


.. Formal Background
.. ----------------------
.. The formal structure structure of a least-squares problem involves 
.. fitting input data :math:`y_i` with functions :math:`f_i(p)` by adjusting
.. fit parameters :math:`p_a` to minimize   

.. .. math::

..    \chi^2 &\equiv \sum_{ij} \Delta y(p)_i\,(\mathrm{cov}_y^{-1})_{ij}\,
..    \Delta y(p)_j  \\
..    &\equiv (\Delta y(p))^\mathrm{T}\cdot \mathrm{cov}_y^{-1}\cdot
..    \Delta y(p)
   
.. where :math:`\mathrm{cov}_y` is the covariance matrix for the input data
.. and

.. .. math::

..     \Delta y(p)_i \equiv f_i(p) - y_i.

.. There are generally two types of input data --- actual data and
.. prior information for each fit parameter --- but we lump these together
.. here since they enter in the same way (that is, the sums over :math:`i`
.. and :math:`j` are over all data and priors).

.. The best-fit values :math:`\overline{p}_a` for the fit parameters are those
.. that minimize :math:`\chi^2`:

.. .. math::

..    (\partial_a \Delta y(\overline{p}))^\mathrm{T}
..    \cdot\mathrm{cov}_y^{-1}\cdot
..    \Delta y(\overline{p}) = 0

.. where the derivatives are :math:`\partial_a = \partial/\partial
.. \overline{p}_a`. The covariance matrix :math:`\mathrm{cov}_p` for these is
.. obtained (approximately) from
    
.. .. math::
    
..         (\mathrm{cov^{-1}_p})_{ab} \equiv 
..     (\partial_a \Delta y(\overline p))^\mathrm{T}
..     \cdot \mathrm{cov}^{-1}_y \cdot
..     (\partial_b\Delta y(\overline p)).

.. Consequently the variance for any function :math:`g(\overline p)` of the
.. best-fit parameters is given by (approximately)

.. .. math::
   
..    \sigma^2_{g} = (\partial g(\overline p))^\mathrm{T} \cdot 
..    \mathrm{cov}_p \cdot \partial g(\overline p)

.. The definition of the covariance matrix implies that it and any variance
.. :math:`\sigma^2_g` derived from it depend linearly (approximately) on the
.. elements of the input data covariance matrix :math:`\mathrm{cov}_y`, at
.. least when errors are small: 

.. .. math::

..    \sigma^2_g \approx \sum_{ij} c(\overline p)_{ij} \,
..     (\mathrm{cov}_y)_{ij}

.. This allows us to associate different portions of the output error 
.. :math:`\sigma^2_g` with different parts of the input error
.. :math:`\mathrm{cov}_y`, creating an "error budget" for 
.. :math:`g(\overline p)`. 
.. Such information helps pinpoint the input errors that most affect the
.. output errors for any particular quantity  :math:`g(\overline p)`, 
.. and also indicates how those output errors might change for a given change
.. in input error.

.. The relationship between the input and output errors is only
.. approximately linear because the coefficients in the expansion depend upon
.. the best-fit values for the parameters, and these depend upon the input
.. errors --- but only weakly when errors are small. Neglecting such variation 
.. in the parameters, the error budget for any quantity is easily computed 
.. using

.. .. math::

..    \frac{\partial (\mathrm{cov}_p)_{ab}}{\partial (\mathrm{cov}_y)_{ij}}
..     = D_{ai}\,D_{bj}
   
.. where

.. .. math::

..    D_{ai} \equiv (\mathrm{cov}_p \cdot \partial \Delta y \cdot 
..       \mathrm{cov}_y^{-1})_{ai}

.. and, trivially,
.. :math:`\mathrm{cov}_p = D\cdot\mathrm{cov}_y\cdot D^\mathrm{T}`.

.. This last formula suggests that 

.. .. math::

..    \frac{\partial \overline{p}_a}{\partial y_i} = D_{ai}.
   
.. This relationship is true in the limit of small errors, as is easily derived
.. from the minimum condition for the fit, which defines (implicitly) 
.. :math:`\overline{p}_a(y)`: Differentiating with respect to
.. :math:`y_i` we obtain

.. .. math::

..    (\partial_a \Delta y(\overline{p}))^\mathrm{T}\cdot\mathrm{cov}_y^{-1}\cdot
..    \frac{\partial\Delta y(\overline{p})}{\partial y_i} = 0

.. where we have ignored terms suppressed by a factor of :math:`\Delta y(p)`.
.. This leads immediately to the relationship above.

.. The data's covariance matrix :math:`\mathrm{cov}_y` is sometimes rather
.. singular, making it difficult to invert. This problem is dealt with using
.. an SVD cut: the covariance matrix is diagonalized, some number of the
.. smallest (and therefore least-well determined) eigenvalues and their
.. eigenvectors are discarded, and the inverse matrix is reconstituted from
.. the eigenmodes that remain. (Instead of discarding modes one can replace
.. their eigenvalues by the smallest eigenvalue that is retained; this is less
.. conservative and usually leads to more accurate results.) 

nonlinear_fit Objects
---------------------  

.. autoclass:: lsqfit.nonlinear_fit

   The results from the fit are accessed through the following attributes
   (of ``fit`` where ``fit = nonlinear_fit(...)``):

   .. attribute:: chi2
   
      The minimum ``chi**2`` for the fit. ``fit.chi2 / fit.dof`` is usually
      of order one in good fits; values much less than one suggest
      that the actual standard deviations in the input data and/or priors are 
      smaller than the standard deviations used in the fit.
      
   .. attribute:: cov
   
      Covariance matrix of the best-fit parameters from the fit. 

   .. attribute:: dof
   
      Number of degrees of freedom in the fit, which equals the number of 
      pieces of data being fit when priors are specified for the fit 
      parameters. Without priors, it is the number of pieces of data minus
      the number of fit parameters.
      
   .. attribute:: logGBF
   
      The logarithm of the probability (density) of obtaining 
      the fit data by randomly sampling the parameter model 
      (priors plus fit function) used in the fit. This quantity is
      useful for comparing fits of the same data to different models, 
      with different priors and/or fit functions. The model with the 
      largest value of ``fit.logGBF`` is the one prefered by the data. 
      The exponential of the difference in ``fit.logGBF`` between two models
      is the ratio of probabilities (Bayes factor) for those models. Differences
      in ``fit.logGBF`` smaller than 1 are not very significant. Gaussian 
      statistics are assumed when computing ``fit.logGBF``. 
      
   .. attribute:: p
   
      Best-fit parameters from fit. Depending upon what was used for
      the prior (or ``p0``), it is either: a dictionary
      (:class:`gvar.BufferDict`) of |GVar|\s and/or arrays of |GVar|\s; or
      an array (:class:`numpy.ndarray`) of |GVar|\s. ``fit.p`` represents a
      multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution which, in Bayesian terminology,
      is the *posterior* probability distribution of the fit parameters.
      
   .. attribute:: pmean
   
      Means of the best-fit parameters from fit (dictionary or array).
      
   .. attribute:: psdev
   
      Standard deviations of the best-fit parameters from fit
      (dictionary or array).
      
   .. attribute:: palt
   
      Same as ``fit.p`` except that the errors are computed directly 
      from ``fit.cov``. This is faster but means that no information about
      correlations with the input data is retained (unlike in ``fit.p``);
      and, therefore, ``fit.palt`` cannot be used to generate error
      budgets. ``fit.p`` and ``fit.palt`` give the same means and normally
      give the same errors for each parameter. They differ only when the
      input data's covariance matrix is too singular to invert accurately
      (because of roundoff error), in which case an SVD cut is advisable.
   
   .. attribute:: transformed_p

      Same as ``fit.p`` but augmented to include the transforms of any 
      log-normal or other parameter implemented using decorator
      :class:`lsqfit.transform_p`. In the case of a log-normal variable
      ``fit.p['logXX']``, for example, ``fit.transformed_p['XX']`` is 
      defined equal to ``exp(fit.p['logXX'])``.

   .. attribute:: p0
   
      The parameter values used to start the fit.
      
   .. attribute:: Q
   
      The probability that the ``chi**2`` from the fit could have been
      larger, by chance, assuming the best-fit model is correct. Good fits have 
      ``Q`` values larger than 0.1 or so. Also called the *p-value* of
      the fit.
      
   .. attribute:: svdcorrection
      
      The sum of all SVD corrections, if any, added to the fit 
      data ``y`` or the prior ``prior``. 
   
   .. attribute:: svdn

      The number of eignemodes modified (and/or deleted) by the SVD cut.

   .. attribute:: nblocks

      A dictionary where ``nblocks[s]`` equals the number of block-diagonal
      sub-matrices of the ``y``--``prior`` covariance matrix that are size
      ``s``-by-``s``. This is sometimes useful for debugging. 

   .. attribute:: time
   
      CPU time (in secs) taken by fit.
      
   The input parameters to the fit can be accessed as attributes. Note 
   in particular attributes:
   
   .. attribute:: prior
   
      Prior used in the fit. This may differ from the input prior if an
      SVD cut is used. It is either a dictionary
      (:class:`gvar.BufferDict`) or an array (:class:`numpy.ndarray`),
      depending upon the input. Equals ``None`` if no prior was specified.
      
   .. attribute:: x
      
      The first field in the input ``data``. This is sometimes the
      independent variable (as in 'y vs x' plot), but may be anything. It
      is set equal to ``False`` if the ``x`` field is omitted from the
      input ``data``. (This also means that the fit function has no ``x``
      argument: so ``f(p)`` rather than ``f(x,p)``.)
      
   .. attribute:: y
   
      Fit data used in the fit. This may differ from the input data if
      an SVD cut is used. It is either a dictionary
      (:class:`gvar.BufferDict`) or an array (:class:`numpy.ndarray`),
      depending upon the input.

   Additional methods are provided for printing out detailed information
   about the fit, testing fits with simulated data, 
   doing bootstrap analyses of the fit errors, 
   dumping (for later use) and loading parameter values, and checking for roundoff
   errors in the final error estimates:

   .. automethod:: format(maxline=0, pstyle='v')
   
   .. automethod:: fmt_errorbudget(outputs, inputs, ndecimal=2, percent=True)
   
   .. automethod:: fmt_values(outputs, ndecimal=None)
