These .py files are simple examples showing how to use lsqfit. Use 'make
run' to run all of them, comparing the output with the corresponding .out
files.

Some of these examples are discussed in the documentation (which is
doc/html/index.html):

	simple.py - "Introduction"
	y-vs-x.py - "Making Fake Data" and "Basic Fits"
	x-err.py - "x has Error Bars"
	p-corr.py - "Correlated Parameters; Gaussian Bayes Factor"
	err-budget.py - "Tuning Priors and the Empirical Bayes Criterion" and
	                "Partial Errors and Error Budgets"

    pendulum.py - fit pendulum motion using a differential-equation 
                  integrator inside the fit function.

To run under a different version of python, say python3 for example, use
'make PYTHON=python3 run'.
