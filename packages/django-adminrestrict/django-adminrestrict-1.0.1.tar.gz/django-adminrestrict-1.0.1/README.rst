        'django.contrib.auth',

Usage
=====

Using ``django-adminstrict`` is extremely simple.  Once you install the application
and the middleware, all you need to do is update the allowed IP addresses `AllowedIP` 
section of the admin pages.

Adding allowed IP addresses
---------------------------

Login to the admin pages and browse to the Adminrestrict app, and
start creating recorded in the `AllowedIP` table.  Just type in the IP
addresses and save records.

Adding allowed IP addresses with wildcards
------------------------------------------

Create a `AllowedIP` entries ending with a "*" to any IPs that start
with the specified patterh. For example, adding `192.*` would allow
addreses starting matching 192.*.*.* to login to the admin pages.

Adding * to disable all restrictions
------------------------------------

Create a single `AllowedIP` record with "*" as the IP address, to
temporarily disable restrictions. In this way, you do not have to
modify settings.py and remove the middleware if you need to disable.

Having at least one `AllowedIP` record with * as the IP address 
effectively disables all restrictions.
