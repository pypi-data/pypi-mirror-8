* make uninstall automatic
* check that render slider inline is working properly. Are there tests for this?
* Could it be possible to 'block options for gallerytype' ( a setting in portal_registry) ? For example 'Galleria',  which is always present ?  
* Be able to control which viewlets / fill slot the gallery will display in.
* be able to add a gallery to any page (like medialog.galleryviewlet, only better :) ).
