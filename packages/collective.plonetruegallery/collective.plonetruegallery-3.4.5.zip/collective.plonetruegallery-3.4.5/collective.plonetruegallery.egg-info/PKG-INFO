        =========================================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        collective.plonetruegallery is a Plone product that implements a very
        customizable and sophisticated gallery. 
        
        How It Works
        ------------
        All you need to do is select the ``Gallery View`` from the ``Display`` drop down
        item for any Folder or Collection content type. Once that is done, a
        ``Gallery Settings`` tab is enabled for the type. With this, you can customize
        the various settings for the Gallery.
        
        
        Supported Display Types
        -----------------------
        
        To install any of the various extra display types, you need to install
        the dependent package in buildout

        Installing all
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you want to install all available galleries, you could add
        
          eggs = 
            ...
            collective.plonetruegallery
            collective.ptg.allnewest
            ...
        
        to buildout's egg section.
        
        This will also install some galleries that are "under development".

        Flickr and Picasa Web Album Support
        -----------------------------------
        * to add support for these type of galleries you must install additional
          packages
        * install collective.ptg.flickr for Flickr support
        * install collective.ptg.picasa for Picasa Web Album
          Support(tested with 1.3.3 and 2.0.12)
        * on Plone 3.x you must also manually install hashlib for picasa support
        * these can just be added to your buildout or installed with easy_install
          or you can add the package to your egg section like
        
        
        Displaying Gallery inline
        -------------------------
        A view (@@placegalleryview) can be used to place the gallery inside of
        other content.
        
        Pop-up effect
        -------------
        
        you could do this::
        
          1) Install http://plone.org/products/collective.prettyphoto
          2) Mark the link to the gallery with "prettyPhoto" style (which 
             has now been added) from Kupu or TinyMCE
        
        Inline Gallery
        --------------
        
        For showing a gallery in another page, try something like this::
        
          <object data="path/to/gallery/@@placegalleryview" height="400" width="500">
            <param name="data" value="path/to/gallery" />
          </object>
        
        Notes for successful inline object tag usage:
        
         * You will have to "whitelist" <object> and <param> in portal_transform safe-html.
         * When editing in Plone 4.2 you will have to switch your editor to Kupu since TinyMCE fracks up the object tag into a flash item. 
         * If testing without Apache in front of your Plone you will need to make sure that the
           "path/to/gallery" path from the example above includes any levels above the Plone object
           in the Zope instance (eg. if your Plone object is inside of a folder named "version1", and
           the name of your gallery is "mygallery", then the path should read "/version1/Plone/mygallery".
           Of course, you will need to remove the "/version1/Plone" part when you put Apache in front
           of your Plone.
        
        Or you can do the same with an iframe
        
        
        Troubleshooting safe-html
        -------------------------
        
          If you have trouble, do this:
          Go to safe_html in portal_transforms tool
          Make sure param and object are valid tags (not nasty tag).
        
          After that, you should flush the cache of ZODB by going to
          1. Zope root app ZMI
          2. Control Panel
          3. Database
          4. main (or whatever zodb you have)
          5. Flush Cache tab
          6. Press "Minimize" button
        
        This will remove from ZODB cache all cooked texts. This procedure is mentioned
        at the top of safe_html in portal_transforms.
        
        
        Upgrading
        ---------
        
        From 0.8*
        ~~~~~~~~~
        The upgrade to version 0.8* is an important and large update. Basically, it
        gets rid of the Gallery type, replaces it with the regular Folder type along
        with a new view applied to the folder, namely the "Gallery View."
        
        You can only successfully upgrade from the 0.8* series by first upgrading
        to a 1.x series release and then upgrading to the 2.x series.
        
        
        From 1.x to 2.x
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        No longer support Slideshow 2 gallery which has been replaced with galleria.
        
        From * to 3.x
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You'll be required to change your respective collective.js dependencies to
        collective.ptg dependencies in buildout, re-run buildout.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Since this product depends on plone.app.z3cform, you'll need to add a few
        overrides for products versions in your buildout if you aren't using recent
        versions of Plone. Good news is that is you're using any other product that
        uses plone.app.z3cform, you'll already be good to go.
        
        Basically, you'll need to add these to your buildout versions section
        ONLY IF you're running a plone < 4.1.
        
        For Plone 4.0::
        
          [versions]
          z3c.form = 2.3.2
          plone.app.z3cform = 0.5.0
          plone.z3cform = 0.6.0
          zope.schema = 3.6.0
        
        
        and Plone 3.x::
        
          [versions]
        	z3c.form = 1.9.0
        	plone.app.z3cform = 0.4.8
        	plone.z3cform = 0.5.10
        	zope.i18n = 3.4.0
        	zope.testing = 3.4.0
        	zope.component = 3.4.0
        	zope.securitypolicy = 3.4.0
        	zope.app.zcmlfiles = 3.4.3
        
        
        These versions are not the exact versions plonetruegallery requires, it's
        just a known working set. If you already have plone.app.z3cform installed
        under different versions or wish to upgrade versions, you're fine doing so.
        
        
        Then once you run buildout with this configuration, install
        collective.plonetruegallery via the the add-on product configuration. Also,
        make sure Plone z3cform support is installed too. If you experience issues
        where no settings appear in the `Gallery Settings` tab,
        reinstall `Plone z3cform support`.
        
        Uninstall
        ---------
        First uninstall the collective.plonetruegallery product just like you would
        any other product. Then, go to ``portal_setup`` in the zmi and click on
        the ``Import`` tab. Once there, select the 
        ``collective.plonetruegallery Uninstall Profile`` profile and run all the
        steps. Once that is done, you can remove the egg from your buildout.
        
        
        Fetching of Images Explained
        ----------------------------
        * When rendering a picasa or flickr gallery, it checks if the images have been
          fetched within a day. If they have not, then it re-fetches the images for
          the gallery.
        * You can also force a specific gallery to be re-fetched by appending
          ``@@refresh`` to the gallery url
        * You can manually refresh all galleries on the site by typing in a url like
          ``mysite.com/@@refresh_all_galleries``  This means you can also setup a
          cron-like job to refresh all the galleries whenever you want to, just
          so it isn't done while a user is trying to render a page.

          sync the po(t) files and compile mo files
          (see http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/21)
          [fRiSi]
        
        * select the random image for subgalleries out of the subgallery's images

          [vangheem]

          [vangheem]

          a page. Fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/27
          [vangheem]
        
        * handle returns and quotes in descriptions. Fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/39
          [vangheem]

          fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/37
          [vangheem]
        
        
        0.9.1rc5
        --------
        
        * use plone.app.contentmenu.interfaces.IDisplayViewsMenu instead of plone_displayviews
          for menu declaration since it doesn't work with plone.app.contentmenu > 2.0b3
          and zope.browsermenu installed.
          [vangheem]
        
        0.9.1rc4
        --------
        
        - import Batch directly from PloneBatch since with Zope 2.13 Batch is not
          available at the package level when plonetruegallery is loaded.

        0.9.1rc3
        --------
        
        * made the basic gallery not store it's cached images since it would never be able to really
          cache them anyways. This fixes the zodb potentially growing forever on sites that use the
          gallery portlet since it needed to calculate the gallery on every new image request, which
          would cause a new write to the database. FYI, packing the database brings it back down to
          it's normal size.
          [vangheem]
        
        0.9.1rc2
        --------
        
        * changed added large plone folder view to code since in Plone 4 it is no longer available.

        --------
        
        * Update to fancybox 1.3.1--should fix http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/19
          from showing up any longer
          [vangheem]
        
        * added easing and scrolling plugins to fancybox so it's nicer now.
          [vangheem]
        
        
        
        0.9.0b1
        -------

          [vangheem]
        
        * fixed plone.app.imaging incompatibility with patches
          it uses--fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/23
          [vangheem]
        
        * fixed fancy box not showing correctly occasionally
          [vangheem]
        
        * restructured display type code to be a little more compatible with templating.
          It was a little messy the way it was done before so it is now slightly
          less customizable for the sake of being more compatible and modular. If any
          gallery types were defined in the old fashion, they may no longer work without
          slight modification. That is what this is now tagged as a 0.9 release.
          [vangheem]
        
        * compatible with cmf.pt now--Chameleon.
          [vangheem]
        
        * gallery portlet now forces the height of the image so it doesn't flicker if
          for some reason the image hasn't finished loading yet.
          fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/24
          [vangheem]
        
        * added plone.app.z3cform as dependency profile
          fixes http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/issues/25
          [vangheem]
        
        * fixed css on gallery portlet to show title properly
          [vangheem]
        
        
        0.8.2b4 ~ March 16
        ------------------
        
        * annoying extra release since the previous one included extra
          "._" po files...
          [vangheem]

          [vangheem]
        
        * fixed max-width screwing up slideshow transition
          with some css
          [vangheem]
        
        * gallery is now plone.app.imaging aware, reflecting

        --------------------------
        
        * Adapting BasicImageInformationRetriever to IObjectManager does not work
          in Plone4 anymore. Use IBaseFolder instead which is also generic for

          [vangheem]
        
        * Override button apply method instead of __call__ method to set the status
          for user warning and to set setting changes. This fixes issue with
          newer version of plone.z3cform not showing updated status message.
          [vangheem]
        
        * Added hashlib to list of install requires for picasa since some versions

        * added go to image support via url like /url/to/gallery?start_image=theTitle. Not exactly perfect, but should work most of the time.  No other way to know what image it is since I don't keep ids on flickr and picasa galleries.  make sure to url encode the title though.
