What The Patch!?
================

What The Patch!? is a library for parsing patch files. It's only purpose is to
read a patch file and get it into some usable form by other programs.

Features
---------

- Parsing of almost all ``diff`` formats (except forwarded ed):

  - normal (default, --normal)
  - copied context (-c, --context)
  - unified context (-u, --unified)
  - ed script (-e, --ed)
  - rcs ed script (-n, --rcs)

- Parsing of several SCM patches:

  - CVS
  - SVN
  - Git

Installation
------------

To install What The Patch!?, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install whatthepatch

Usage
=====

Let us say we have a patch file containing some changes, aptly named
'somechanges.patch':

.. code-block:: diff

    --- lao	2012-12-26 23:16:54.000000000 -0600
    +++ tzu	2012-12-26 23:16:50.000000000 -0600

Parsing
-------

Here is how we would use What The Patch!? in Python to get the changeset for
each diff in the patch:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import whatthepatch
    >>> with open('somechanges.patch') as f:
    ...     text = f.read()
    ...
    >>> for diff in whatthepatch.parse_patch(text):
    ...     print(diff)
    ...
    diff(header=header(
                        index_path=None,
                        old_path='lao',
                        old_version='2012-12-26 23:16:54.000000000 -0600',
                        new_path='tzu',
                        new_version='2012-12-26 23:16:50.000000000 -0600'
                        ),
        changes=[
            (1, None,   'The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;'),
            (2, None,   'The name that can be named is not the eternal name.'),
            (3, 1,      'The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;'),
            (4, None,   'The Named is the mother of all things.'),
            (None, 2,   'The named is the mother of all things.'),
            (None, 3,   ''),
            (5, 4,       'Therefore let there always be non-being,'),
            (6, 5,      '  so we may see their subtlety,'),
            (7, 6,      'And let there always be being,'),
            (9, 8,      'The two are the same,'),
            (10, 9,     'But after they are produced,'),
            (11, 10,    '  they have different names.'),
            (None, 11,  'They both may be called deep and profound.'),
            (None, 12,  'Deeper and more profound,'),
            (None, 13,  'The door of all subtleties!')
            ]
        )

*Edited to show structure of the results*

The changes are listed as they are in the patch, but instead of the +/- syntax
of the patch, we get a tuple of two numbers and the text of the line.
What these numbers indicate are as follows:

#. ``( 1, None, ... )`` indicates line 1 of the file lao was **removed**.
#. ``( None, 2, ... )`` indicates line 2 of the file tzu was **inserted**.
#. ``( 5, 4, ... )`` indicates that line 5 of lao and line 4 of tzu are **equal**.

Please note that not all patch formats provide the actual lines modified, so some 
results will have the text portion of the tuple set to ``None``.

Applying
--------

To apply a diff to some lines of text, first read the patch and parse it.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import whatthepatch
    >>> with open('somechanges.patch') as f:
    ...     text = f.read()
    ...
    >>> with open('lao') as f:
    ...     lao = f.read()
    ...
    >>> diff = [x for x in whatthepatch.parse_patch(text)]
    >>> diff = diff[0]
    >>> tzu = whatthepatch.apply_diff(diff, lao)
