monasca-persister
=============

The Monitoring Persister consumes metrics and alarm state transitions from the Message Queue and stores them in the Metrics and Alarms database.

Although the Persister isn't primarly a Web service it uses DropWizard, https://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/, which provides a nice Web appliction framework to expose an http endpoint that provides an interface through which metrics about the Persister can be queried as well as health status. 

The basic design of the Persister is to have one Kafka consumer publish to a Disruptor, https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor, that has output processors. The output processors use prepared batch statements to write to the Metrics and Alarms database.

The number of output processors/threads in the Persister can be specified to scale to more messages. To horizontally scale and provide fault-tolerance any number of Persisters can be started as consumers from the the Message Queue. 

# Build

Requires monasca-common from https://github.com/stackforge/monasca-common. Download and build following instructions in its README.md. Then build monasca-persister by:

```
mvn clean package
```

# TODO

* Purge metrics on shutdown
* Add more robust offset management in Kafka. Currently, the offset is advanced as each message is read. If the Persister stops after the metric has been read and prior to it being committed to the Metrics and Alarms database, the metric will be lost. 
* Add better handling of SQL exceptions.
* Complete health check.
* Specify and document the names of the metrics that are available for monitoring of the Persister.
* Document the yaml configuration parameters.
