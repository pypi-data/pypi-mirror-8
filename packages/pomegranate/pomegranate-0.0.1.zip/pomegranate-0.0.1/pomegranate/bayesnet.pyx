		Add many transitions at the same time, in one of two forms. 

		(1) If both a and b are lists, then create transitions from the i-th 
		element of a to the i-th element of b with a probability equal to the
		i-th element of probabilities.

		Example: 
		model.add_transitions([model.start, s1], [s1, model.end], [1., 1.])

		(2) If either a or b are a state, and the other is a list, create a
		transition from all states in the list to the single state object with
		probabilities and pseudocounts specified appropriately.

		Example:
		model.add_transitions([model.start, s1, s2, s3], s4, [0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.9])
		model.add_transitions(model.start, [s1, s2, s3], [0.6, 0.2, 0.05])

		group. Otherwise, either groups can be a list of group identities, or
