``rms2d`` command in ``cpptraj`` of Amber is quite useful to find several structural clusters.
You can visually classify the trajectories into several clusters of structures and can find out a most stable structure in each cluster by finding out the frame which has a smallest value of total RMSd in each cluster.
However, it is a tough job to find out **exact** frame number which has a smallest value.

``rms2dfinder`` will help you to find the frame numbers which has minimum mean RMSd in each cluster. What you need to do is just select the region on rms2d plot and the software tell you

-   A minimum mean RMSd (Mean value of summed up RMSd in the region)
-   A frame number which has the minimum mean RMSd
-   Start and end frame number

Install
-------------

Use `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ to install as:

    pip install rms2dfinder

All libraries are automatically installed if you install ``rms2dfinder`` via ``pip``.


Usage
------------

    usage: rms2dfinder.py [-h] infile

    A helper utility to find minimum mean RMSd structures of clusters found in
    rms2d plot.
