Description: Accuri2fcs is a command line program for the conversion of accura .c6         formatted flow cytometry files to standard .fcs. In practise this is relatively         straightforward as Accuri files are simply zip structures containing multiple .fcs.         in a structured format. However, extracting and naming these individual files is a         little more tricky. This program allows rapid batch processing of multiple Accura         files into multiple .fcs files, with regular expression sample name matching, splitting         and copying to build the output filenames. It can get quite complicated, see the examples.
