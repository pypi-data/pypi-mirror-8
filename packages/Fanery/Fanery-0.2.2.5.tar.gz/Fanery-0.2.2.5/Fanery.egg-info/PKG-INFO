Description: Fanery
        ======
        
        Application development framework.
        
        
        Project Goals
        -------------
        
        - Strong security by default.
        - Focus on being developer-oriented.
        - Promote funcional pythonic style.
        - Promote continuous testing+profiling.
        
        
        Why Fanery
        ----------
        
        Fanery is an opinionated development framework build around a few simple concepts:
        
        - Strong cryptography must be transparent and enabled by default.
        - Encryption must not rely on cryptographic keys generated client side.
        - Encryption must only rely on unbroken high-quality ciphers/algorithms/implementations.
        - Session security must not rely on SessionIDs, bizare URLs, secure cookies, secret tokens, magic keys or any other piece of information that can be guessed or stolen during transmission.
        - Capture and re-transmission of encrypted messages must be pointless.
        - The framework must protect transparently against brute-force and authenticated sessions abuse.
        - The framework must handle transparently input serialization to harmless/built-in only object types.
        - The framework must not depend on strict/pre-defined configuration style/format and/or directory structure.
        - The framework must not tie to a particular storage or UI technology.
        - The framework must provide the facilities for easy testing, debugging and profiling.
        - The framework must not rely on components that inhibit elastic/horizontal scalability.
