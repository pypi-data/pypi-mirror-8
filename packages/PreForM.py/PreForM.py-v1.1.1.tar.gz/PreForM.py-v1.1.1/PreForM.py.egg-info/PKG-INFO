Description: A very simple and stupid preprocessor for modern Fortran projects. PreForM.py supports the most used cpp pre-processing directives and provides advanced features typical of templating systems. Even if PreForM.py is currently Fortran-agnostic (it being usable within any programming languages) it is focused on Fortran programming language.
