------------

Released on 2013-02-27.

* Layout bug fixes:

  - Correctly trim whitespace at the end of lines.
  - Fix some cases with floats within inline content.

.. _text hyphenation: http://weasyprint.org/docs/features/#hyphenation


Version 0.16
------------

Released on 2012-12-13.

* Add the :obj:`zoom` parameter to :meth:`HTML.write_pdf` and
  :meth:`Document.write_pdf() <weasyprint.document.Document.write_pdf>`
* Fix compatibility with old (and buggy) pycairo versions.
  WeasyPrint is now tested on 1.8.8 in addition to the latest.
* Fix layout bugs related to line trailing spaces.


Version 0.15
------------

Released on 2012-10-09.

* Add a low-level API that enables painting pages individually on any
  cairo surface.
* **Backward-incompatible change**: remove the :meth:`HTML.get_png_pages`
  method. The new low-level API covers this functionality and more.
* Add support for the ``font-stretch`` property.
* Add support for ``@page:blank`` to select blank pages.
* New Sphinx-based and improved docs
* Bug fixes:

  - Importing Pango in some PyGTK installations.
  - Layout of inline-blocks with `vertical-align: top` or `bottom`.
  - Do not repeat a block’s margin-top or padding-top after a page break.
  - Performance problem with large tables split across many pages.
  - Anchors and hyperlinks areas now follow CSS transforms.
    Since PDF links have to be axis-aligned rectangles, the bounding box
    is used. This may be larger than expected with rotations that are
    not a multiple of 90 degrees.


Version 0.14
------------

Released on 2012-08-03.

* Add a public API to choose media type used for @media.
  (It still defaults to ``print``). Thanks Chung Lu!
* Add ``--base-url`` and ``--resolution`` to the command-line API, making it
  as complete as the Python one.
* Add support for the ``<base href="...">`` element in HTML.
* Add support for CSS outlines
* Switch to gdk-pixbuf instead of Pystacia for loading raster images.
* Bug fixes:

  - Handling of filenames and URLs on Windows
  - Unicode filenames with older version of py2cairo
  - ``base_url`` now behaves as expected when set to a directory name.
  - Make some tests more robust


Version 0.13
------------

Released on 2012-07-23.

* Add support for PyGTK, as an alternative to PyGObject + introspection.
  This should make WeasyPrint easier to run on platforms that not not have
  packages for PyGObject 3.x yet.
* Bug fix: crash in PDF outlines for some malformed HTML documents


Version 0.12
------------

Released on 2012-07-19.

* Add support for collapsed borders on tables. This is currently incompatible
  with repeating header and footer row groups on each page: headers and footers
  are treated as normal row groups on table with ``border-collapse: collapse``.
* Add ``url_fetcher`` to the public API. This enables users to hook into
  WeasyPrint for fetching linked stylesheets or images, eg. to generate them
  on the fly without going through the network.
  This enables the creation of `Flask-WeasyPrint
  <http://packages.python.org/Flask-WeasyPrint/>`_.


Version 0.11
------------

Released on 2012-07-04.

* Add support for floats and clear.
  Together with various bug fixes, this enables WeasyPrint to pass the Acid2
  test! Acid2 is now part of our automated test suite.
* Add support for the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height and
  max-height properties in @page. The size property is now the size of the
  page’s containing block.
* Switch the Variable Dimension rules to `the new proposal
  <https://github.com/SimonSapin/css/blob/master/margin-boxes-variable-dimension>`_.
  The previous implementation was broken in many cases.
* The ``image-rendering``, ``transform``, ``transform-origin`` and ``size``
  properties are now unprefixed. The prefixed form (eg. -weasy-size) is ignored
  but gives a specific warning.


Version 0.10
------------

Released on 2012-06-25.

* Add ``get_png_pages()`` to the public API. It returns each page as
  a separate PNG image.
* Add a ``resolution`` parameter for PNG.
* Add *WeasyPrint Navigator*, a web application that shows WeasyPrint’s
  output with clickable links. Yes, that’s a browser in your browser.
  Start it with ``python -m weasyprint.navigator``
* Add support for `vertical-align: top` and `vertical-align: bottom`
* Add support for `page-break-before: avoid` and `page-break-after: avoid`
* Bug fixes


Version 0.9
-----------

Released on 2012-06-04.

* Relative, absolute and fixed positioning
* Proper painting order (z-index)
* In PDF: support for internal and external hyperlinks as well as bookmarks.
* Added the ``tree`` parameter to the ``HTML`` class: accepts a parsed lxml
  object.
* Bug fixes, including many crashes.

Bookmarks can be controlled by the ``-weasy-bookmark-level`` and
``-weasy-bookmark-label`` properties, as described in `CSS Generated Content
for Paged Media Module <http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-gcpm/#bookmarks>`_.

The default UA stylesheet sets a matching bookmark level on all ``<h1>``
to ``<h6>`` elements.


Version 0.8
-----------

Released on 2012-05-07.

* Switch from cssutils to tinycss_ as the CSS parser.
* Switch to the new cssselect_, almost all level 3 selectors are supported now.
* Support for inline blocks and inline tables
* Automatic table layout (column widths)
* Support for the ``min-width``, ``max-width``, ``min-height`` and
  ``max-height`` properties, except on table-related and page-related boxes.
* Speed improvements on big stylesheets / small documents thanks to tinycss.
* Many bug fixes

Version 0.7.1
-------------

Released on 2012-03-21.

Change the license from AGPL to BSD.


Version 0.7
-----------

Released on 2012-03-21.

* Support page breaks between table rows

* Bug fixes

Only avoiding page breaks before/after an element is still missing.


Version 0.6.1
-------------

Released on 2012-03-01.

Fix a packaging bug. (Remove use_2to3 in setup.py. We use the same
codebase for Python 2 and 3.)


Version 0.6
-----------

Released on 2012-02-29.

* *Backward incompatible*: completely change the Python API.
  See the documentation: http://weasyprint.org/using/#as-a-python-library
* *Backward incompatible*: Proper margin collapsing.
  This changes how blocks are rendered: adjoining margins "collapse"
  (their maximum is used) instead of accumulating.
* Support images in ``embed`` or ``object`` elements.
* Switch to pystacia instead of PIL for raster images
* Add compatibility with CPython 2.6 and 3.2. (Previously only 2.7
  was supported)
* Many bug fixes


Version 0.5
-----------

Released on 2012-02-08.

* Support for the ``overflow`` and ``clip`` properties.
* Support for the ``opacity`` property from CSS3 Colors.
* Support for CSS 2D Transforms. These are prefixed, so you need to use
  ``-weasy-transform`` and ``-weasy-transform-origin``.


Version 0.4
-----------

Released on 2012-02-07.

* Support ``text-align: justify``, ``word-spacing`` and ``letter-spacing``.
* Partial support for CSS3 Paged Media: page size and margin boxes with
  page-based counters.
* All CSS 2.1 border styles
* Fix SVG images with non-pixel units. Requires CairoSVG 0.3
* Support for ``page-break-before`` and ``page-break-after``, except for
  the value ``avoid``.
* Support for the ``background-clip``, ``background-origin`` and
  ``background-size`` from CSS3 (but still with a single background
  per element)
* Support for the ``image-rendering`` from SVG. This one is prefixed,
  use ``-weasy-image-rendering``. It only has an effect on PNG output.


Version 0.3.1
-------------

Released on 2011-12-14.

Compatibility with CairoSVG 0.1.2


Version 0.3
-----------

Released on 2011-12-13.

* **Backward-incompatible change:** the 'size' property is now prefixed (since
  it is in an experimental specification). Use '-weasy-size' instead.
* cssutils 0.9.8 or higher is now required.
* Support SVG images with CairoSVG
* Support generated content: the ``:before`` and ``:after`` pseudo-elements,
  the ``content``, ``quotes`` and ``counter-*`` properties.
* Support ordered lists: all CSS 2.1 values of the ``list-style-type`` property.
* New user-agent stylesheet with HTML 5 elements and automatic quotes for many
  languages. Thanks Peter Moulder!

* Various bug fixes


Version 0.2
-----------

Released on 2011-11-25.

* Support for tables.

* Support all values of vertical-align except top and bottom. They are
  interpreted as text-top and text-bottom.

Tables have some limitations:
Only the fixed layout and separate border model are supported.
There are also no page break inside tables so a table higher
than a page will overflow.


Version 0.1
-----------

Released on 2011-10-28.

First packaged release. Supports "simple" CSS 2.1 pages: there is no
support for floats, tables, or absolute positioning. Other than that
most of CSS 2.1 is supported, as well as CSS 3 Colors and Selectors.
