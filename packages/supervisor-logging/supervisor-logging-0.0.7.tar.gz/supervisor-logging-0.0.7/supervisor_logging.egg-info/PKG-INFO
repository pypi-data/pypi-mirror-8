Description: Supervisor-logging
        ==================
        
        A [supervisor] plugin to stream events to an external Syslog instance (for

        Installation
        ------------
        
        ```
        pip install supervisor-logging
        ```
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The Syslog instance to send the events to is configured with the environment
        variables:
        
        * `SYSLOG_SERVER`
        * `SYSLOG_PORT`
        * `SYSLOG_PROTO`
        
        Add the plugin as an event listener:
        
        ```
        [eventlistener:logging]
        command = supervisor_logging
        events = PROCESS_LOG
        ```
