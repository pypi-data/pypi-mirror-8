0.6 (2014-11-13)
================

- Added Python 3 compatibility. Fixes issue #25.

- Bower components and local components can be created based on a path
  relative to the directory in which the components are created using
  ``bowerstatic.module_relative_path``.

- The injector and the publisher can now also be used directly by
  providing a WebOb request and response. Third-party frameworks that
  already use WebOb (such as Morepath and Pyramid) can make use of
  this to integrate with on the level of their own request and
  response objects, instead of on the WSGI level.

0.5 (2014-09-24)
================

- On some platforms and filesystems (such as Linux ext3, Mac OS X)
  ``os.path.getmtime()`` returns timestamps with the granularity of
  seconds instead of subseconds such as Linux ext4. We go for second
  granularity now by default for autoversioning as this should be good
  enough during development.

  The test for autoversioning was assuming sub-second granularity and
  this test failed. This test is now skipped on Mac OS X. What didn't
  help was weird code in BowerStatic that cut off the last bit of the
  microsecond isoformat -- this was removed.

  This fixes bug #20. (Thanks to Michael Howitz for the bug report)

- Display a nicer error messages when a component depends on another one
  that doesn't exist. Thanks for Michael Howitz for the improvement.

- Internal toposort module was not imported relative to package,
  which could lead to errors in some circumstances. Thanks TylorS for
  reporting! Fixes issue #24.

0.4 (2014-09-08)
================

- There was a bug in the new ``component(name)`` method to obtain the
  component, because it wouldn't work for local components. Fixing this
  properly took a significant refactoring:

  * the ComponentCollection gains its own fallback behavior, much
    simpler to implement than in LocalComponentCollection.

  * UrlComponent is now gone and Component gains that functionality; it
    keeps a reference to the collection itself now.

  * add a lot of free-standing functions to the methods.

  * an earlier hack passing the component collection through an argument
    is now gone.

- The new ``.component()`` API to get a component from a collection
  explicitly in order to get its URL is gone again as it conflicted
  with an earlier API on local component collections. Instead use
  ``collection.get_component(name)``.

0.3 (2014-08-28)
================

- BowerStatic failed to initialize if a component was discovered
  without a ``main``. These are handled now -- if you try to include a
  path to such a resource, no extra inclusions are generated. Fixes #5.

- If ``main`` was an array, only the first such resource was
  loaded. The correct behavior should be to load all these
  resources. This required a reworking of how resources get created;
  instead of creating a single resource for a path, a list of
  resources is created everywhere. Fixes #6 (and was mentioned in #5).

- Introduce a ``component(name)`` method on the components
  object. Given a component name it will give an object that has a
  ``url()`` method.  This can be used to obtain the URL of a component
  directory, which is sometimes useful when client-side code needs to
  construct URLs itself, such as for templates. Fixes issue #8.

- You can register a renderer for a particular extension type using,
  for example, ``bower.renderer('.js', render_js)``, where
  ``render_js`` takes a URL and should return a string with a HTML
  snippet to include on the page.

0.2 (2014-07-18)
================

- Even if the same resource is included multiple times, it will only
  be included once. Thanks Ying Zhong for the bug report and suggested
  fix.

0.1 (2014-07-07)
================

- Initial public release.
