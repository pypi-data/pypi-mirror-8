      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Description: Docker-Registry-Index-DynamoDB
        ==============================
        
        A DynamoDB index for the [docker-registry](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry). By default, docker-registry stores its index using [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) in a relational database. This project provides a module that allows you to store the index in [Amazon AWS DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). This is particularly useful if you are using docker-registry's Amazon S3 driver for your Image Store. With DynamoDB you will have a high-availability index to match the high-availability image store.

        - [Manual install](#manual-install)
        - [Implementation Details](#implementation-details)
        
        # Quick start
        
        TODO - create document a Docker image configured to use this extension.
        
        # Configuration
        
        See the [docker-registry](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry) project for details on configuring the docker-registry. This project uses the same configuration mechanism, an you may add the configuration to the same configuration file used by docker-registry. The configuration used by this code is stored in the docker-registry config in the extensions section: For example:
        
        ```yaml
        common: &common
            # add the following
            search_backend: docker_registry_index.dynamodb
        
        extensions:
            dynamodb_index:
                database: _env:DYNAMODB_DATABASE:docker-registry
                repository_table: _env:DYNAMODB_REPOSITORY_TABLE
                version_table: _env:DYNAMODB_VERSION_TABLE
                region: _env:DYNAMODB_REGION
                access_key: _env:DYNAMODB_ACCESS_KEY
                secret_access_key: _env:DYNAMODB_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        ```
        
        If you do not specify a `repository_table`, then the table name will be formed by adding `-repository` to the end of the `database` name. If you do not specify a `version_table`, then `-version` is added to the `database` name. Note that there is no concept of a database in DynamoDB, the `database` name here is simply used as a prefix for calculating the table names when no table names are specified in the configuration.
        
        The `region` will default to the `s3_region`, which in turn defaults to 'us-east-1'.
        
        The `access_key` and `secret_access_key` default to the value of the `s3_access_key` and `s3_secret_access_key` respectively. If not specified then you must configure these by other means. This code uses [boto Python interface to Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/boto/boto) to access the DynamoDB. Therefore, you can use a boto configuration file in your home directory, or in /etc. For details see the [boto configuration](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/) documentation.
        
        So if you use the DynamoDB with no configuration specified it will default to using 'docker-registry-repository' as the `respository_table` name, and 'docker-registry-version' as the `version_table` name. The region, access_key and secret_access_key will default to the S3 values or whatever is found in boto configuration. But remember, you must still set the search_backend to docker_registry_index.dynamodb.
        
        # Manual Install
        
        Simply install and run the docker-registry as normal, but first ensure that this python package (docker-registry-index-dynamodb) is installed and set the docker-registry configuration to use it.
        
        * Install docker-registry as normal.
        * Install this python package. 
        ** Available at PYPI: `pip install docker-registry-index-dynamodb`
        * Make sure the docker-registry configuration has the `search_backend` set to `docker_registry_index.dynamodb`.
        * Optionaly set other configuration as specified above and in the docker-registry project.
        * Run the docker-registry.
        ** Installing the docker-registry also installs a `docker-registry` command.
        
        # Implementation details
        
        ## Startup
        
        At startup the Index class (the one that does all the work) checks to see if the configured DynamoDB table names exist, and if not, create them. 
        
        If the tables were created, then the repositories already located in the data store (which is presumably the s3 data store) will be loaded into the repository table. This means that you can delete the DynamoDB tables, and they will be reloaded when the docker-registry is started. You should probably not delete the tables while the docker-registry is running, although they are only used for query.
        
        A simple lock is used in the Index constructor to prevent multiple threads attempting to create and/or load the database at the same time.
