    Outline: (1) write YAML to temp file, (2) invoke editor on it, (3) check
    file was changed, (4) check it's valid, (5) update database.  Need an 
    issue validate() method.

    Implemented editor class.  Now need a way to get a default editor program,
    from env vars.

    Added editor function, and more object validity checks (since users
    would be able to create valid YAML that's an invalid issue).
