title: Name substitution not done in issue description
desc: |-
  Easily fixed, but the bigger problem is a bunch of existing issues with
  issue names in their description instead of unique ID references.  It's
  possible to add a command which would go through the database and fix
  these, but there's no guarantee it'd get it right -- if an issue is
  dropped or archived, this changes the name mapping.

  - Sigh.  Found this just after the 0.6.1 release.

    Added demo of the problem to the example db, and fixed it.  Now, how to
    handle fixing of existing descriptions?

    Added a 'fixdb' command which goes through and fixes up IDs in all
    issue descriptions.
