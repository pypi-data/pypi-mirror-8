Description: funced-up-functions
        ===================
        
        Various function-related manipulators
        
        This is meant to be a relatively simple library that adds support for miscellaneous tricks with functions.
        
        Some of the tools include:
        
        - Overload sets with argument constraints
        - A slightly-improved version of functools.wraps, which also copies the signature of the function
        - Set of functions that gets dispatched based on the first argument - proof of concept
        - A dictionary class that dispatches to another dictionary if a lookup fails
