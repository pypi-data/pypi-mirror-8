Road Map
========


Here's a list of upcoming releases of circuits in order of "next release
first".

Each bullet point states a high level goal we're trying to achieve for
the release whilst the "Issues List" (*linked to our Issue Tracker*)
lists specific issues we've tagged with the respective milestone.

.. note:: At this stage we don't have any good estimates for our milestones
          but we hope we can improve this with future releases and start
          adding estimates here.
