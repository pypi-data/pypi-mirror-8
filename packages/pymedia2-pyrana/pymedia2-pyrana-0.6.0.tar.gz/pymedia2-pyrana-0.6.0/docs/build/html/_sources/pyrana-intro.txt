Pyrana is a pure-python package which provides easy, pythonic and
powerful handling of multimedia files.

-  easy: pyrana does not submerge you with tons of options and details,
   but is filled with sane defaults. pyrana aims to be multimedia
   processing what
   `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_ is for http.

-  pythonic: pyrana wants to play nice and work well with the other
   well-established relevant python packages:
   `Pillow <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow>`_,
   `pygame <http://pygame.org>`_,
   `PySDL2 <http://pysdl2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_,
   `PyAudio <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/>`_,
   `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ compatibility is coming soon.

-  powerful: pyrana provides an independent API, but is built on the
   great foundations provided by the `powerful FFMpeg
   libraries <http://ffmpeg.org>`_.

pyrana is a modern, pure python package which is developed for python 3
and compatible with python 2.7, which takes great
advantage of `CFFI <http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.7/>`_, so
the compatibility with `pypy <http://pypy.org>`_ is just one step away.

pyrana offers a minimum 100% unit-test and documentation coverage, and
put great emphasis on small, yet complete and workable examples. Last
but not least, pyrana is released under the very liberal ZLIB license.
