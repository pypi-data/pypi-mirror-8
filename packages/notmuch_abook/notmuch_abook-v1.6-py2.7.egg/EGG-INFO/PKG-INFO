Description: 
        Notmuch Addressbook Utility
        
        Notmuch Addressbook manager for vim
        ===================================
        
        DEPENDENCES
        -----------
        
        * notmuch with python bindings
        
        INSTALL
        -------
        
        * Standalone install
        
        if you do not want to use the vim script file, you can install the module as follows:
        
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        or using:
        
        ```
        pip install notmuch_abook
        ```
        
        * Vimscript install
        
        Use vundle to install this script, add to your vimrc:
        
        ```
        Bundle "guyzmo/notmuch-abook"
        ```
        
        for convenience, you can create a symlink to your bin directory:
        ```
        ln -s $HOME/.vim/bundle/notmuch-abook/pylibs/notmuch_addresses.py ~/bin/notmuch-abook
        ```
        
        CONFIGURATION
        -------------
        
        Open notmuch configuration file (usually $HOME/.notmuch-config) and add:
        
        ```
        [addressbook]
        path=/home/USER/.notmuch-abook.db
        backend=sqlite3
        ```
        
        where USER is your username (or at any other place)
        
        Default notmuch query string is
        
        ```
        NOT tag:junk AND NOT folder:drafts AND NOT tag:deleted
        ```
        
        If you prefer something else, you can specify it in notmuch configuration file:
        
        ```
        [addressbook]
        path=/home/USER/.notmuch-abook.db
        backend=sqlite3
        query=folder:Inbox OR folder:Sent
        ```
        
        If you use a non-default notmuch configuration file, you can set it in your vimrc with:
        
        ```
        let g:notmuchconfig = "~/.notmuch-config-custom"
        ```
        
        In your favorite mail filter program, add a rule such as (for procmail), so all new mail will be parsed:
        
        ```
        :0 Wh
        | python $HOME/.vim/bundle/notmuch-abook/pylibs/notmuch_addresses.py update
        ```
        
        If you can't use procmail (eg if you are using offlineimap) then you could put the following few lines at the start of the [post-new hook](http://notmuchmail.org/manpages/notmuch-hooks-5/) (**before** you remove the new tag).  Also note this is shell syntax, so you'll have to adapt if your hook is in another language.
        
        ```
        # first update notmuch-abook
        for file in $(notmuch search --output=files tag:new) ; do
            cat $file | $HOME/bin/notmuch-abook update
        done
        ```
        
        USAGE
        -----
        
        For the first time, you shall launch the script as follows to create the addresses database (it takes ~20 seconds for 10000 mails):
        
        ```
        python $HOME/.vim/bundle/notmuch-abook/pylibs/notmuch_addresses.py create
        ```
        
        and then, to lookup an address, either you use the vimscript to complete (<c-x><c-u>) the name in a header field,
        or you can call it from commandline:
        
        ```
        python $HOME/.vim/bundle/notmuch-abook/pylibs/notmuch_addresses.py lookup Guyz
        ```
        
        the script will match any word beginning with the pattern in the name and address parts of the entry.
