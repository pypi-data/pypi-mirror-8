title
=====
Text string used for the figure title

ntraces
=======
The number of traces to use in the model. This is equivalent to the number of lateral samples in the earth model.

pad
===
The amount of earth before the feature of interest. This becomes the depth of the first rock layer.

reflectivity_method
===================
The reflectivity model to use when calculating the AVO response.

theta
=====
The angle to use for the reflectivity calculation. For multiple angles, enter text as start,end, spacing.

wavelet
=======
The type of wavelet to use as the impulse. Additionally controlled by the f argument.

f
===
The frequency(ies) of the wavelet. Ormsby requires four(comma delimited), sweep requires two, and ricker requires one. A wavelet bank of ricker wavelets can be generated by using a frequency list: start, stop, step.
 
colourmap
==========
A matplotlib colour map to use for earthmodels.

wiggle_skips
=============
Using a wiggle overlay can crowd the plot, so setting a number wiggles to skip will reduce the number of wiggles displayed.

base1
======
The base plot for the first plot pane. Overlays will be plotted on top of this plot.

overlay1
=========
Overlay plot for the first plot plane. Plot will draw over base1 plot.

base2
======
The base plot for the first plot pane. Overlays will be plotted on top of this plot.

overlay2
=========
Overlay plot for the first plot plane. Plot will draw over base2 plot.

opacity
========
Set the opacity of the overlay plots.
