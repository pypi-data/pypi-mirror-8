Description: The deployer is a Python framework for automatic application deployment on
        Posix systems, usually through SSH. When set up, it can be called as a
        library, but usually, people use it through an interactive command line.
        
        Some key features are:
        
        * Interactive execution of remote commands, locally, they will appear in a
          pseudo terminal (created with openpty), so that even editors like Vim or
          Emacs works fine when you run them on the remote end.
        * Reusability of all deployment code is a key point. It's as declarative as
          possible, but without loosing Python's power to express everything as
          dynamic as you'd like to. Deployment code is hierarchically structured, with
          inheritance where possible.
        * Parallel execution is easy when enabled, while keeping interaction with
          these remote processes possible through pseudoterminals. Every process gets
          his own terminal, either a new xterm or gnome-terminal window, a tmux pane, or
          whatever you'd like to.
        * Logging of your deployments. New loggers are easily pluggable into the
          system.
