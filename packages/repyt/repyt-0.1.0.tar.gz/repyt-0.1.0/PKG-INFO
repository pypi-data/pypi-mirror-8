        =====
        
        Automatically re-run Python commands when files change.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install repyt
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            repyt [-h] [--command COMMAND] [args]
        
        Where::
        
            COMMAND             Any command to execute in the shell, as a string. This
                                doesn't even have to be a Python command!
            args                Arguments as you would normally pass to the `python`
                                command.
            -h or --help        Show this help message and exit.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Use it just like you would use the :code:`python` command:
        
        ::
        
            repyt hello_world.py
        
        Including args is totally fine:
        
        ::
        
            repyt hello_world.py --world="Earth"
        
        This is equivalent to:
        
        ::
        
            repyt -c 'python hello_world.py --world="Earth"'
        
        The command arg doesn't even have to be a Python command:
        
        ::
        
            repyt -c 'echo "Yo Adrian! I did it!"'
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        repyt detects changes in the current directory and sub-directories, and re-runs
        your Python script, application, or any other command when files are changed by
        you or your editor.
        
        It kindly ignores hidden files and a bunch of other stuff that probably isn't
        important.
        
        You should use it just like you use the :code:`python` command, if possible.
