Cloudwatch-to-Graphite (leadbutt) is a small utility to take metrics from
CloudWatch to Graphite.


Installation
------------

Install using pip::

    pip install cloudwatch-to-graphite


Usage
-----

Cloudwatch-to-Graphite uses `boto`_, so make sure to follow its `configuration
instructions`_. The easiest way to do this is to set up the
``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` environment variables.

Set up a config.yaml. You can copy the included config.yaml.example. If your
graphite server is at graphite.local, you can send metrics like::

    leadbutt | nc -q0 graphite.local 2003

If you have several configs you want to switch between, you can specify a
custom configuration file and send extra data with::

    leadbutt --config-file=production.yaml -n 20 | nc -q0 graphite.local 2003

You can even generate configs on the fly and send it in like::

    generate_config_from_inventory | leadbutt --config-file=- | nc -q0 graphite.local 2003

Prior Art
---------

Cloudwatch-to-Graphite was inspired by edasque's `cloudwatch2graphite`_. I was
looking to expand it, but I wanted to use `boto`_.
