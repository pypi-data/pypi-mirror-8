        A Sphinx extension for linking to your project's issue tracker. Includes roles for linking to both issues and user profiles, with built-in support for GitHub (though this works with other services).
        
        Example
        *******
        
        For an example usage, check out `marshmallow's changelog <http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html#changelog>`_, which makes use of the roles in this library.
        
        Installation and Configuration
        ******************************
        ::
        
            $ pip install sphinx-issues
        
        Add ``sphinx_issues`` to ``extensions`` in your ``conf.py``. If your project is on Github, add the ``issues_github_path`` config variable. Otherwise, use ``issues_uri``.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # docs/conf.py
        
            #...
            extensions = [
                #...
                'sphinx_issues',
            ]
        
            # Github repo
            issues_github_path = 'sloria/marshmallow'
        
            # equivalent to
            issues_uri = 'https://github.com/sloria/marshmallow/issues/{issue}'
        
        Usage
        *****
        
        Use the ``:issue:`` role in your docs like so:
        
        .. code-block:: rst
        
            See issue :issue:`42`
        
            See issues :issue:`12,13`
        
        
        Use the ``:user:`` role in your docs to link to user profiles (Github by default, but can be configured via the ``issues_user_uri`` config variable).
        
        .. code-block:: rst
        
            Thanks to :user:`bitprophet` for the idea!
        
        Credits
        *******
        
        Credit goes to Jeff Forcier for his work on the `releases <https://github.com/bitprophet/releases>`_ extension, which is a full-featured solution for generating changelogs. I just needed a quick way to reference Github issues in my docs, so I yoinked the bits that I needed.
