A Sphinx extension for linking to your project's issue tracker. Includes roles for linking to both issues and user profiles, with built-in support for GitHub (though this works with other services).

Example
*******

For an example usage, check out `marshmallow's changelog <http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html#changelog>`_, which makes use of the roles in this library.

Installation and Configuration
******************************
::

    $ pip install sphinx-issues

Add ``sphinx_issues`` to ``extensions`` in your ``conf.py``. If your project is on Github, add the ``issues_github_path`` config variable. Otherwise, use ``issues_uri``.

.. code-block:: python

    # docs/conf.py

    #...
    extensions = [
        #...
        'sphinx_issues',
    ]

    # Github repo
    issues_github_path = 'sloria/marshmallow'

    # equivalent to
    issues_uri = 'https://github.com/sloria/marshmallow/issues/{issue}'

Usage
*****

Use the ``:issue:`` role in your docs like so:

.. code-block:: rst

    See issue :issue:`42`

    See issues :issue:`12,13`


Use the ``:user:`` role in your docs to link to user profiles (Github by default, but can be configured via the ``issues_user_uri`` config variable).

.. code-block:: rst

    Thanks to :user:`bitprophet` for the idea!

Credits
*******

Credit goes to Jeff Forcier for his work on the `releases <https://github.com/bitprophet/releases>`_ extension, which is a full-featured solution for generating changelogs. I just needed a quick way to reference Github issues in my docs, so I yoinked the bits that I needed.
