Description: Lograptor is a tool which provides a command-line interface for system logs processing.
        
        Pattern matching's searches can be performed together with filtering
        rules and scope delimitation options. Each run can produce
        a report that can be easily sent by e-mail or saved into a file system
        directory.
        The program can parse logs written in RFC 3164 and RFC 5424 formats.
        Lograptor require Python >= 2.6, and is provided with a base configuration for a set
        of well known applications. You can easily extend this set adding new applications
        with specific pattern search rules.
