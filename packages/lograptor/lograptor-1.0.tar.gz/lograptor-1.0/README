LOGRAPTOR
----------
Lograptor is a search tool for system logs written in legacy BSD syslog
format RFC 3164 and for IETF syslog protocol RFC 5424.

The program can perform searches in syslog files like as the UNIX command 
"grep", but with the addition of some filters and parameters, useful to
restrict the search field and retrieve the relevant informations from log 
files. You could specify parameters like hostname, application, date,
time range, plus a set of filters on message data.

Lograptor can also produce reports and publish them into a directory or send
them by e-mail. The report may be a general or a specific report tailored
for some accounts or hosts.

The basic idea is to have a compact and highly configurable CLI tool for
system logs analysis. The log analysis is based on application or device
that originated the message, using a set of rules for matching and for
report composition.

Please send feedbacks for bugs, feature requests, suggestions, comments and
criticism.

Very special thanks to Konstantin ("Icon") Ryabitsev, the author of Epylog
package, a software from whom Lograptor was inspired and from whom has
inherited part of the source code.

OBTAINING
---------
https://github.com/brunato/Lograptor
git://github.com/brunato/Lograptor.git


INSTALL
-------
Easiest way is to get and install the RPM/DEB package. To installing from
source uncompact the tarball into a directory.
Then cd in the directory and type:

  python setup.py build install

Lograptor package and source requires python >= 2.6 (included python 3.0+). 


CONFIGURE
---------
After the installation edit the files in /etc/lograptor to reflect your 
environment:

  /etc/lograptor/lograptor.conf        Default main configuration file
  /etc/lograptor/report_template.html  Report HTML template
  /etc/lograptor/report_template.txt   Report plain text template
  /etc/lograptor/conf.d/*.conf         Configuration files for applications

For more info about main configuration file please see "man lograptor.conf". 
For each application a configuration file is needed. Logs of unconfigured 
applications are simply ignored by the program. For more info please see 
"man lograptor-apps".


USAGE
-----

  lograptor [options] [FILE ...]
  lograptor [options] [-e PATTERN | -f PATTERNS_FILE ] [FILE ...]

Lograptor has many CLI options. Some options are identical to those of
UNIX command "grep". If FILE arguments list is empty the program
processes the log files of the last 24 hours.
For more information on usage options see "lograptor --help" or
"man lograptor".

TODO
----

 * Improve the anonymized output feature;
 * Introduce several different levels of details as a program option,
   in order to produce more or less verbose reports;
 * Try an integration with RFC 3161 timestamp services, in order to
   mark rotated log files and the produced reports;
 * Maybe examine the opportunity to translate a log format to another format.
