Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The ``IStagingSupport`` behavior is used for enabling the plone.app.iterate
        functionality for Dexterity content. It allows you to perform the checkout
        and checkin operations to work on a copy of your original content.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Just use the behavior ``plone.app.stagingbehavior.interfaces.IStagingSupport``
        in your Dexterity content-type.
        
        In your *profiles/default/types/YOURTYPE.xml* add the behavior::
        
            <?xml version="1.0"?>
            <object name="example.conference.presenter" meta_type="Dexterity FTI"
               i18n:domain="example.conference" xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n">
        
             <!-- enabled behaviors -->
             <property name="behaviors">
                 <element value="plone.app.stagingbehavior.interfaces.IStagingSupport" />
             </property>
        
            </object>
        
        
        The IStagingSupport behavior just adds the referred staging support to your
        content-type, but it does not enable it.
        
        You have to set the "versioning" option in the Plone types control panel
        (/@@types-controlpanel) to either "Manual" or "Automatic" for activating
        versioning.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.1 (2014-10-20)
        ----------------
        
        * use `index` instead of `template` for info viewlet to allow overriding the 
          template with zcml registrations (sync approach with that used in 
          p.a.iterate)
          [cewing]
        
        * Fix a problem with the implementation of dexterity support at plone.app.linkintegrity,
          when this behavior is used with plone.app.referenceablebehavior the delete_confirmation form
          was failing because the object than is being deleted doesn't have an intid.
          With this patch the get_relations method simply returns an empty list in this case.

        * Renamed package to plone.app.stagingbehavior.
          [deo]

          baseline object.
          [deo]
        
        * Added a workaround to allow the checkin operation to succeed.

        * Removed dependency to plone.relations, made some cleanups.
