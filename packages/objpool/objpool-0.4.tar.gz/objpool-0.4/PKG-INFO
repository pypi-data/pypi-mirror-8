        =======
        
        objpool provides a generic library for pooling resources as objects. As an
        example, it includes a pool for httplib HTTP connections, but it is generalized
        and expects you to extend it to create your own pooled objects.
        
        Usage::
        
        To see how to create your own pooled types of objects, see the example
        implementation at objpool/http.py
