- Fixed a bug that caused axis labels to be incorrectly placed when hiding tick 
  labels using ``set_visible(False)``. [#111]

- Fixed a bug that caused tick labels to not always appear. [#110]

- Fixed a bug that caused the clip path for images to not be updated when
  making subsequent changes after drawing the figure. [#117]

- Fixed a bug that caused the clip path for images to not be updated after
  calling reset_wcs. [#120]

- Added ``CoordinateHelper.get_axislabel()`` method. [#122]

- Improve handling of get/set_xlabel/ylabel. [#94, #126]

- WCS instances from ``wcsaxes.wcs_wrapper`` can now be used to instantiate
  Matplotlib plots with the ``projection=`` keyword. [#136]
