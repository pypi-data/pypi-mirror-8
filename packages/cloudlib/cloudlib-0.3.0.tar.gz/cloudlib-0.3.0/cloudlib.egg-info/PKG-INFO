        Middleware for in application use
        =================================
        
        Ever wish you didn't have to develop some general purpose libraries and or
        middleware which you simply tote around between applications making simple
        tweaks when appropriate or blindly copying and pasting as needed? If so,
        then this is a library you can sink your code into.
        
        
        Why
        ---
        
        I built this because I use the same code over and over again and I'm tired of
        copying the same bits between projects. So now, if I have something that's
        general purpose enough I'm going to put it in library which I'll use throughout
        my applications as I develop them.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Argument parsing for CLI applications
        * HTTP requests
        * Universal logging
        * Outbound email messaging
        * Linux package installation
        * Configuration file parsing
        * Shell commands
        * Various utilities

        Building the Docs
        -----------------
        
        Clone the repo, navigate to the docs directory and execute the following.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html
        
        
        Once complete the docs will be in the `docs/_build/html` directory.
        
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To run tests, go to the root directory of the ``cloudlib`` module and execute
        the command `tox`. this will automatically run all tests for Python 2.6 - 2.7
        
        Doc tests are also used in this library. To run doc tests, go to the docs
        directory in this root of this module and execute `make doctest`.
