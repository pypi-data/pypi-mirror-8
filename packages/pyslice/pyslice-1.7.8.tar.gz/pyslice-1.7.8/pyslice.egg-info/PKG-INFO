        Welcome to Pyslice - dataset template engine's documentation!
        =============================================================
        Pyslice is a specialized templating system that replaces variables in a template data set with numbers taken from all combinations of a grouped series of numbers. It creates a dataset from input template files for each combination of variables in the series. 
        
        The main function of Pyslice is to provide utility functions for parametric modeling. Parametric modeling is a process of varying many inputs to a model. A drawback to parametric modeling is that there are usually hundreds to thousands of data sets to prepare and a corresponding number of model runs. Pyslice will create the model data sets and manage the model runs, or place the model runs in a queue managed by other software. Pyslice is also useful in establishing the sensitivity of a model to changing parameters.

        Installation
        ============
        
        At the command line::
        
            $ pip install pyslice
            # OR
            $ easy_install pyslice
         
        Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed::
        
            $ mkvirtualenv pyslice
            $ pip install pyslice
        
        Development

        Changes
        =======
        2013-09-04: v1.7
            * Reworked the documentation
            * Cross compatibility between 2.7 and 3.3 helped out with 'six'.
            * Git didn't do what I want with the moves, but
              * Moved pyslice.py to pyslice/__init__
              * Moved pyslice_lib to pyslice/pyslice_lib
              * Ran 'autopep8' on all files - especially useful on PySPG
            * Added a README.txt that gives some description.
            * Moved to sphinx, restructured text
            * Minor improvements to setup.py to allow 'upload_docs' to work.
            * Finished transition to git.  Deleted CVSROOT and moved everything up
              a directory.
            * Demoed all parts of the functionality in the example.
        
        2005-08-30: v1.6
        Moved to threads rather than 'os.fork/os.exec' which means that pyslice.py should be able to run on Windows, though not tested.  Eliminated a bunch of code required by the 'os.fork/os.exec' that should make pyslice.py easier to maintain.
        
        2005-06-06: v1.5
        Uses 'pyslice.ini' instead of 'pyslice.conf'.  This allows the use of .ini editors to easily map to the correct format.
        
        2005-05-30: v1.4
        Can pull variable values from statistical distributions in Python's 'random' package. 
        Uses os.path.walk to make considerable faster. 
        Minor code clean-up 
        
        2004-12-16: v1.3
        Now depends on Python 2.x or better. Am now using the PySPG library (http://pyspg.sourceforge.net/) in order to develop the variable sets. Because of PySPG now have the capability of doing geometric and list based parameter generation. 
        
        2001-07-10: v1.1
        Removed Python 2.x dependencies. Variables can now use floating point. Works correctly to just create data sets by setting max_processes = 0 in pyslice.conf. Changes to documentation. 
        
        2001-07-10: v1.0
        Initial release
