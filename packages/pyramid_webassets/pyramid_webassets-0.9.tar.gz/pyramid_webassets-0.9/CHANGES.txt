0.9 (2014-10-21)
================

Features
--------

- Support for overriding named bundles when using the ``webassets.bundles``
  setting. Files earlier in the list take precedence and can override named
  bundles defined in later files. Combined with asset specifications for the
  file names this makes it easy to extend the bundle configuration of other
  packages.

0.8 (2014-08-04)
================

Features
--------

- Support versions of webassets v0.8.x, v0.9.x, and 0.10.x.

- Support glob specifications for input files.

- Introduced support for specifying the base directory and input files, and
  output directories using asset specs. Patches by Randall Leeds and John
  Anderson, documentation by Javier Gonel. See
  https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/13
  https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/14
  https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/31 and
  https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/41 .

- A new configuration directive, ``add_webassets_setting``, that updates the
  provided key and value in the webassets environment configuration can be
  called from ``Configurator`` instances.

- A new configuration directive, ``add_webassets_path``, that adds an
  additional mapping from a path to a URL prefix can be called from
  ``Configurator`` instances. Patch by Jason Brumwell.

- Support for ``auto_build``, ``jst_namespace``, and ``url_expire``
  webassets settings. Patches by Svante Paldan, Olaf Conradi, and Randall
  Leeds. See https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/15
  https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/17 and
  https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/20 .

- A new ``paths`` setting allows a JSON dictionary of mappings from paths to
  URLs to be specified in order to support multiple load paths and URL
  prefixes. Patch by metagriffin.

- Support for multiple values in the ``load_path`` setting. Patch by Greg
  Kempe. See https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/33 .

- A new ``cache_max_age`` setting controls the expiration and caching
  behavior of the static view. The value of this setting is passed through to
  the ``add_static_view`` invocation.

- A ``bundles`` setting can now be specified which lists YAML files to parse
  for bundle definitions. Earlier entries override bundles defined in later
  entries. Patch by metagriffin and multiple value support by Randall Leeds.
  See https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/35 .

- Configuration values prefixed with the string 'json:' are parsed as JSON
  before being passed to webassets. Patch by metagriffin.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Assets can now be built without an active request.

- The ``cache`` and ``manifest`` options now support valid non-boolean values
  as described by the webassets documentation. Patch by Mike Wirth. See
  https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/11 .

- If the ``cache`` argument specifies a directory ensure that it exists.
  Patch by metagriffin. See https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/29 .

Documentation
-------------

- Cleaned up documentation markup. Patch by Michael Merickel.
  https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/18

- Fix typo in documentation of ``url_expire`` setting. The setting had been
  spelled (incorrectly) as ``url_expires``. Patch by Greg Kempe.
  See https://github.com/pyramid_webassets/issues/34 .

- Add an example of building assets from the command line.

- Include the MIT License.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- Support for webassets releases older than v0.8 has been dropped.

- A static view for the configured directory and url is no longer added
  automatically. Set the configuration value ``static_views`` to true to have
  it added when pyramid_webassets is included.
