Description: Tango Photos
        =====
        
        Tango-Photos is a reusable app for photo galleries in Django. While it forms a key component of Tango, it can also be dropped into an existing non-Tango project. 
        
        
        ##Installation:
        
            pip install tango-photos 
        
        or
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/tBaxter/tango-photos.git
        
        tango_shared is a dependency. It will be installed. 
        
        ## Usage:
        Add 'photos' and 'tango_shared' to your installed apps, then run syncdb or migrate.
