python-edl
==========

A python EDL (Edit Decision List) parsing library, based on the ruby EDL
library by Julik Tarkhanov http://guerilla-di.org/edl/. Still a work in
progress so collaboration welcome.

Uses pytimecode.py to handle the Timecode mathematics and should run on
Python 2.7+

https://github.com/simonh10/python-edl

Usage::

    from edl.edl import Parser
    parser=Parser('23.98')
    with open('file.edl') as f:
        edl=parser.parse(f)
        for event in edl.events:
            print "Event Number:"+str(event.num)
            print "Source file:"+str(event.source_file)
            print "Clip Name:"+str(event.clip_name)

Accepted framerate values ['60', '59.94', '50', '30', '29.97', '25', '24',
'23.98'] whole number frame rates are more tested than others, but the accuracy
relies heavily on accuracy of the pytimecode library.
