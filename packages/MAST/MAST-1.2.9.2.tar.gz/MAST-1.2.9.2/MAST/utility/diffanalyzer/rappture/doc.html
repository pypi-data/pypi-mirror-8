		<p style="font-family:arial; font-size:13px; text-align:justify;">This tool takes as input particle position data from dynamic simulations and computes the mean squared displacement for all particles as a function of time. The tracer diffusion coefficient is then calculated from the slope of the mean squared displacement vs time curve.</p>
