# py-prefork-server #

## ABOUT ##
A python based prefork server loosely modelled after the perl 
Net::Server::Prefork.  This will allow you to build a simple prefork
python server by just implementing hooks in a subclass.

## WARNING ##
The 0.1.x and 0.2.x releases are *NOT* compatible!  0.2.x is mostly PEP 8
compliant while 0.1.x is not.  Beyond that, they are functionally equivalent.
It should be noted that the 0.1.x will no longer be supported moving forward.

## INSTALL ##

You can install using the standard Python package install

    tar -xvzf py-prefork-server-X.X.X.tar.gz
    cd py-prefork-server-*
    python setup.py install

You can also install via *pip* or *easy_install*

    pip install py-prefork-server
