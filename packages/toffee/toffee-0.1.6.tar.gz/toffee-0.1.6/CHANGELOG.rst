CHANGELOG
=========

Version 0.1.6

- Added support for Python 3.4.
- Dropped support for Python 3.2.
- Tests that delete fixture objects before teardown is called no longer cause
  SQLAlchemy to invalidate the transaction (and thus potentially cause later
  tests to fail unexpectedly).
- Added a scope argument to Seq(), that determines whether the sequence counter
  is reset at the start of each fixture set up or only once, at the start of
  the test run.

Version 0.1.5

- Licensing: toffee is now licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
- Bugfix: Fixed exception in LazyRecorderFactory.destroy_object during fixture
  teardown

Version 0.1.4

- Added toffee.TestWithFixture

Version 0.1.3

- The data mapper factories (SQLAlchemy and Storm) support querying for
  existing objects in fixtures
- Added experimental SQLAlchemy support

Version 0.1.2

- Made setting factoryoptions more flexible. It's now possible to change the
  default flush/commit behavior of StormFactory per fixture class and or at
  setup time when using the context manager syntax.

Version 0.1.1

- Bugfix: StormFactory did not flush/commit the store on fixture teardown
  teardown, meaning the store would not be left clean for subsequent operations

Version 0.1

- initial release
