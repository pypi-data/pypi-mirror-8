Description: =================================================
        lima: Lightweight Marshalling of Python 3 Objects
        =================================================
        
        **lima** takes arbitrary Python objects and converts them into data structures
        native to Python. The result can easily be serialized into JSON, XML, and all
        sorts of other things. lima is Free Software, lightweight and fast.
        
        
        Key Features
        ============
        
        Lightweight
            lima has only a few hundred SLOC. lima has no external dependencies.
        
        Fast
            lima tries to be as fast as possible while still remaining pure Python 3.
        
        Focused
            lima doesn't try to do an ORM's job and it doesn't try to do a JSON
            library's job.
        
        Extensible
            Build complex schemas out of simpler ones. Extend existing fields types or
            define your own.
        
        Easy to learn
            lima is not only fast but also fast (and easy) to learn.
        
        Well documented
            lima has a comprehensive tutorial and more than one line of docstring per
            line of Python code
        
        Free
            lima is Free Software, licensed under the terms of the MIT license (see the
            LICENSE file for details).
        
        
        lima at a Glance
        ================
        
        .. code-block:: python

            import lima
        
            # a model
            class Book:
                def __init__(self, title, date_published):
                    self.title = title
                    self.date_published = date_published
        
            # a marshalling schema
            class BookSchema(lima.Schema):
                title = lima.fields.String()
                published = lima.fields.Date(attr='date_published')
        
            book = Book('The Old Man and the Sea', datetime.date(1952, 9, 1))
            schema = BookSchema()
            schema.dump(book)
            # {'published': '1952-09-01', 'title': 'The Old Man and the Sea'}
