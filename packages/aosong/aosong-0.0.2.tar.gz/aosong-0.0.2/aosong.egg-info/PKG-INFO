Description: # AOSONG Sensors
        
        Python package that provides support for AOSONG Sensor.
        
        This package and it's modules have been organized to support additional AOSONG
        sensors. It currently only supports the [AM2315 Temperature and Humidity
        Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/AM2315.pdf). Additional sensors are
        encouraged and welcomed.  Please submit a Pull Request.
        
        The original author of this library was
        [Sopwith](http://sopwith.ismellsmoke.net). This repository was originally forked
        from the code provided by the author on [their
        blog](http://sopwith.ismellsmoke.net/?p=104).  The purpose of the repository is
        to provide a pythonic library that can be installed with `pip` and `setuptools`.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Python 3
        * [Quick2wire Python API](https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-python-api)
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Recommended
        ```shell
        pip install --process-dependency-links aosong
        ```
        
        ### Manual
        `python setup.py install`
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        >>> from aosong import am2315
        >>> sensor = am2315.Sensor()
        >>> sensor.temperature()
        19.1
        >>> sensor.celsius()
        19.1
        >>> sensor.fahrenheit()
        66.3
        >>> sensor.temperature(True)
        66.3
        >>> sensor.humidity()
        70.1
        >>> sensor.data()
        (70.0, 19.1, 66.3)
        >>>
        
        ```
        
        ### Sensor.data()
        Sensor.data() returns a tuple containing three values.
        
        `(41.8, 23.5, 74.3)`
        
        The first value is the current relative humidity
        The second value is the current temperature in Celsius.
        The third value is the current temperature in Fahrenheit.
        
        ### Sensor.temperature()
        
        Sensor.temperature() returns the current temperature in Celsius.
        
        If you want the current temperature returned in Fahrenheit pass True as a parameter.
        
        `sensor.temperature(True)`
        
        ## Test script:
        
        am2315.py is a unittest script you should run to ensure your sensor
        is wired correctly. If it is, you should see the below test results.
        
        `python setup.py test`
