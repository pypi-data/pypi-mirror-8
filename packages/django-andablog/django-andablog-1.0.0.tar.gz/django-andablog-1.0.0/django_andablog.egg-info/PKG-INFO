        History
        -------
        
        1.0.0 (2014-11-20)
        ------------------
        **Backwards Incompatible with 0.1.0.**
        This release includes a rename of the django app package from djangoandablog to andablog to better follow
        community conventions. This of course is a very large breaking change, which is why the version is 1.0.
        As this is the second version and we have been out such a short time. My hope is that few if any people
        are using this app yet. If you are, please submit an issue on GitHub and I will try to help you migrate away.
        
        0.1.0 (2014-11-16)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
