Logilab's packaging tools
=========================

Set of tools which aims to help the packaging of Python projects for Debian
(with a rough support for rpm packages).

lgp is mainly a wrapper around puilder that ease the creation of chroot-based
environment in which lgp can build debian packages targeting several Debian or
Ubuntu distributions.

The main commands provided by lgp are:

- `lgp build` Build a debian package
- `lgp check` Check project in the current working directory
- `lgp clean` Clean the project directory
- `lgp setup` Set up and manage build images
- `lgp shell` Run a script or interactive shell in a chrooted distribution


Quickstart
----------

Note: lgp uses pbuilder, so it is a good idea to have de local proxy for debian
      and ubuntu repositories (eg. apt-cache or similar).

First you have to create the base archive for a targeted distribution:

  ~# lgp setup -c create -d wheezy -a amd64
  ~# lgp setup -c create -d trusty -a i386

Note: on wheezy, debootstrap has limited knowledge of recent Ubuntu
      distributions. If you want to build a chroot for an yet-unknown
      Ubuntu distribution, you must add them in
      /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/

      Simply add symlinks with the distrib codename to gutsy, like:

  ~# ln -s gutsy /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/trusty

Ensure the destination directory for your built packages exists (~/dists by default):

  $ mkdir ~/dists

Then you can try to build a package from its sources directory:

  $ hg clone http://hg.logilab.org/master/logilab/common
  $ cd common
  $ lgp build -d wheezy

See doc/packaging_howto.txt for more informations on how to use lgp.
