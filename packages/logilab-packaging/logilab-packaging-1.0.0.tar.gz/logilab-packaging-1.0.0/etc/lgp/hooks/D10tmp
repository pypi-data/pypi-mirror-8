# Notes on usage of $TMPDIR
# http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/pbuilder-doc/pbuilder-doc.html#tmpdir

# If you are setting $TMPDIR to an unusual value, of other than /tmp, you will
# find that some errors may occur inside the chroot, such as dpkg-source
# failing.

# There are two options, you may install a hook to create that directory, or
# set 'export TMPDIR=/tmp' in pbuilderrc. Take your pick.

# from example script provided as examples/D10tmp with pbuilder
# create $TMP and $TMPDIR
[ -n "$TMP" -a ! -d "$TMP" ] && mkdir -p "$TMP" || true
[ -n "$TMPDIR" -a ! -d "$TMPDIR" ] && mkdir -p "$TMPDIR" || true
