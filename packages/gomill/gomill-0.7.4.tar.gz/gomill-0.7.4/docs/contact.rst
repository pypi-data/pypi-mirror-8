Gomill's home page is http://mjw.woodcraft.me.uk/gomill/.

Updated versions will be made available for download from that site.

I'm happy to receive any bug reports, suggestions, patches, questions and so
on at <matthew@woodcraft.me.uk>.

I'm particularly interested in hearing about any |gtp| engines (even buggy
ones) which don't work with the ringmaster.
