The Gomill library
==================

Gomill is intended to be useful as a Python library for developing |gtp|- and
|sgf|-based tools.

As of Gomill |version|, not all of the library API is formally documented.
Only the parts which are described in this documentation should be considered
stable public interfaces.

Nonetheless, the source files for the remaining modules contain fairly
detailed documentation, and the :doc:`example scripts <example_scripts>`
illustrate how some of them can be used.
