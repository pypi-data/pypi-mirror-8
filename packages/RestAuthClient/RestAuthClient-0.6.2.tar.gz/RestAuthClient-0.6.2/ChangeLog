RestAuthClient 0.6.2 (09 September 2014)

  General:
  * This project is now hosted on github:
    https://github.com/RestAuth/RestAuthClient
  * RestAuthClient now requires Python 2.7 or later.

  Breaking changes:
  * The classes representing users and groups have been moved for consistency:
    * restauth_user.User is now user.RestAuthUser
	* group.Group is now group.RestAuthGroup
  * Factory methods get(), get_all(), create() and create_test() are now
	classmethods, so e.g. group.get_all now becomes RestAuthGroup.get_all.
  * User and group no longer have a common base class, this allows us to
    import Users/Groups in the common module.

  New features:
  * Methods that return a list of entities now support the optional "flat"
    parameter to only return a list of names instead of objects.
  * RestAuthConnection now accepts the source_address and timeout parameters,
    in Python 3, it also accepts an SSLContext.
  * Path elements in HTTP requests are now quotet separately and without any
    safe characters. This means that entity names with '/' are encoded
	correctly.
  * Various speed improvements.

  Bugfixes:
  * Do not decode HTTP responses, as this brakes binary protocols (e.g. BSON)
  * Do not use mutable default arguments, this is dangerous. See:
	http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/mutable-default-arguments/
  
  Testing:
  * The test cases now use the content handler specified by the MIME
    environment variable.
  * Enable branch coverage and reach a test-coverage of 100%.
  * Group tests now have users created via setUpModule, speeds up group tests
    300%.
  * setup.py test now exits with status 1 if testcases fail.


RestAuthClient 0.6.1 (01 April 2013)

  * Add --part option to setup.py to only test part of the test-suite.
  * Add a small benchmark script to test performance of RestAuth services.
  * Fix intersphinx documentation.
  * Cleanup of import statements.
  * Use cleaner isinstance() instead of ...__class__ == <class>
  * Switch to distribute
  * add install_requires to setup.py

RestAuthClient 0.6.0 (15 September 2012)

  This release adds support for version 0.6 of the RestAuth protocol. This
  brings the following enhancements:
  * Support for HTTP status code 403 FORBIDDEN
  * Support for setting multiple user properties in a single HTTP call.

  General:
  * The whole code is now pep8 clean

RestAuthClient 0.5.1 (13 November 2011)

  General:
  * remove false statement that this library depends on python-mimeparse
  * Adapt to changes in newest RestAuthCommon version
  * RestAuthConnection.set_content_handler also accepts unicode
  
  build-related:
  * 'clean' target now removes more generated files
  * handle version in a more centralized way
  * The 'debian' branch now includes a ready-to-use debian package.
  * The new command 'prepare_debian_changelog' updates debian/changelog to the
    newest version
  
  test functions:
  * restauth_user.create_test, User.create_property_test and group.create_test
    now behave exactly like their non-test counterparts. The only difference
    is that user and group creation test methods do not return an instance of
    their respective classes.
  * create_property_test now also throws PreconditionFailed
  * Added documentation to the test methods
  
  Python3:
  * Enable SSL certificate verification in python 3.2 or later
  
  Tests:
  * Add restauth-common git-checkout to path, if its found in the same
    directory as this directory.
