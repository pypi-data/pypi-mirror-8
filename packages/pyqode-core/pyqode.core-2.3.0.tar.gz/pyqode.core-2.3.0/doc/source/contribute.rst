Contributing
============

pyQode is an open-source project, and it needs your help to go on growing and improving.

You can contribute in many different ways:

    - reports new bugs/features on the `issue tracker`_
    - add support for another language by creating a new pyqode namespace package and submitting it on the
      `issue tracker`_. If your package is good (have tests,...), it might end up being part of the official
      pyqode packages.
    - fork the project and send pull requests to merge your work

If you have any question, just open an issue on the issue tracker.

Adding support for a new language
---------------------------------

Support for new language must be added through a new pyqode namespace package (as it has been
done for pyqode.python). To submit the your new package, simply open an issue. If your package meets all
the requirements, it might end up being part of the official pyqode packages and you as new team member ;)

Tips for submitting a post request:
-----------------------------------
Pull Requests are great (on the dev branch)! Readme/Documentation changes are ok in the master branch.

    - Fork the Repo on github.
    - Add your name to AUTHORS.txt
    - Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the dev branch.

The master branch is used for the stable releases, following the
`git workflow`_.

Please use **PEP8** to style your code except for the naming conventions. We
use the Qt naming conventions to remains coherent and homogeneous with the rest
of the Qt API.
