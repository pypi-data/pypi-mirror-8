trie_mod: 
	A simple Trie implementation written in Python.

	- trie_mod.py: 			the Python module
	- test-trie-mod:		unit tests for the Python module
	- sample:			    example use

Note: Derived from https://github.com/bdimmick/python-trie .
Modified for pylint, pep8 and Python 2.4-3.4 compatibility by Dan Stromberg.
Tested on CPython 2.[4567], CPython 3.[01234], Pypy 2.4.0, Pypy3 2.3.1 and Jython 2.7b3.

Also note that you can get ordered tries by passing a treap, red-black tree or similar ordered
dictionary-like datastructure.  When you use a trie with a dict container (the default), you
do not get ordered data out when iterating over it.
