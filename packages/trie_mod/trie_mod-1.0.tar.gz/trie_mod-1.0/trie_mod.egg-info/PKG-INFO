Description: 
        A pure python trie class is provided.  It is
        thoroughly unit tested, passes pylint, and is known
        to run on CPython 2.[567], CPython 3.[01234], Pypy 2.4.0, Pypy3 2.4.0 and
        Jython 2.7b3.
        
        This trie looks like a dictionary that's always
        sorted by key.  It's well suited to storing large, natural-language dictionaries.
        
        Note that although the iteration API is lazy, the implementation
        is still eager.
        
        It gives constant time access to a potentially-large collection
        of strings.
