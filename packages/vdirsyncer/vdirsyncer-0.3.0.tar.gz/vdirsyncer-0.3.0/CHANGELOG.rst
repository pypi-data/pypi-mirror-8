Version 0.3.0
=============

*released on 20 September 2014*

- Add ``verify_fingerprint`` parameter to
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.HttpStorage`,
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CaldavStorage` and
  :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.CarddavStorage`,
  see issue `#99`_ and pull request `#106`_.

- Add ``passwordeval`` parameter to :ref:`general_config`, see issue `#108`_
  and pull request `#117`_.

- Emit warnings (instead of exceptions) about certain invalid responses from
  the server, see issue `#113`_.  This is apparently required for compatibility
  with Davmail.

Version 0.2.2
=============

*released on 04 August 2014*

  URLs and certain servers. On top of that, the security check was nonsensical.
  See issues `#87`_ and `#91`_.

- Change some errors to warnings, see issue `#88`_.

- Improve collection autodiscovery for servers without full support.

.. _`#87`: https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer/issues/87

.. _`#91`: https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer/issues/91

Version 0.2.1
=============

*released on 05 July 2014*

- Fix bug where vdirsyncer shows empty addressbooks when using CardDAV with
  Zimbra.

- Fix infinite loop when password doesn't exist in system keyring.

- Colorized errors, warnings and debug messages.

- vdirsyncer now depends on the ``click`` package instead of argvard.

Version 0.2.0
=============

*released on 12 June 2014*

- vdirsyncer now depends on the ``icalendar`` package from PyPI, to get rid of
  its own broken parser.

- vdirsyncer now also depends on ``requests_toolbelt``. This makes it possible
  to guess the authentication type instead of blankly assuming ``basic``.

- Fix a semi-bug in caldav and carddav storages where a tuple (href, etag)
  instead of the proper etag would have been returned from the upload method.
  vdirsyncer might do unnecessary copying when upgrading to this version.

- Add the storage :py:class:`vdirsyncer.storage.SingleFileStorage`. See issue
  `#48`_.

- The ``collections`` parameter for pair sections now accepts the special
  values ``from a`` and ``from b`` for automatically discovering collections.
  See :ref:`pair_config`.

- The ``read_only`` parameter was added to storage sections. See
  :ref:`storage_config`.

.. _`#48`: https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer/issues/48
