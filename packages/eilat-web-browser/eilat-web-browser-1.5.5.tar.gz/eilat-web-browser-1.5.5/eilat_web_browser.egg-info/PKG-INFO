Description: 
        
            Keyboard driven, security and privacy focused web browser build in PyQt4's
            webkit engine.
        
            Features:
        
            * simple source code, focused on promoting auditing
            * Isolation of instances for facebook, google, twitter; configurable
              for more sites
            * Console logging of resources actually retrieved and cookies set or
              attempted
            * hjkl, ^j, ^h, etc. keyboard navigation
        
            New in 1.5.5:
        
            * hooks for playing videos on 'mpv'
            * redone the log system for message clarity
            * access-key navigation ('Ã±' or ';', then one or two-letters link tag)
        
            Install:
        
            First install PyQt4 for Python 3 by whatever means result more appropiate;
            using a pyvenv is recommended. Then do `pip install eilat-web-browser`. Pip
            will not install PyQt, but will install all the other dependences.
        
            Quick usage notes:
        
            * facebook, twitter, google will be blacklisted unless they are the first
              URL visited on a tab (and then the tab will hold to that site only)
            * `^t` creates a new tab
            * `Ctrl+Space` toggles the status bar
            * `g` starts an in-page search; `escape` in the search frame closes it
            * javascript is off by default; to enable one-tab-only, press `q` and reload
              with F5 or `r`
        
            Read `README.md` and the wiki (https://github.com/jsoffer/eilat/wiki) for
            lots of details - there's a lot of non obvious functionality that requires
            a bit of reading, e.g. modal keys or navigating through isolated tabs
