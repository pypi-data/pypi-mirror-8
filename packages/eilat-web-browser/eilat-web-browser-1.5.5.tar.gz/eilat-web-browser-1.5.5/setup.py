    long_description="""

    Keyboard driven, security and privacy focused web browser build in PyQt4's
    webkit engine.

    Features:

    * simple source code, focused on promoting auditing
    * Isolation of instances for facebook, google, twitter; configurable
      for more sites
    * Console logging of resources actually retrieved and cookies set or
      attempted
    * hjkl, ^j, ^h, etc. keyboard navigation

    New in 1.5.5:

    * hooks for playing videos on 'mpv'
    * redone the log system for message clarity
    * access-key navigation ('Ã±' or ';', then one or two-letters link tag)

    Install:

    First install PyQt4 for Python 3 by whatever means result more appropiate;
    using a pyvenv is recommended. Then do `pip install eilat-web-browser`. Pip
    will not install PyQt, but will install all the other dependences.

    Quick usage notes:

    * facebook, twitter, google will be blacklisted unless they are the first
      URL visited on a tab (and then the tab will hold to that site only)
    * `^t` creates a new tab
    * `Ctrl+Space` toggles the status bar
    * `g` starts an in-page search; `escape` in the search frame closes it
    * javascript is off by default; to enable one-tab-only, press `q` and reload
      with F5 or `r`

    Read `README.md` and the wiki (https://github.com/jsoffer/eilat/wiki) for
    lots of details - there's a lot of non obvious functionality that requires
    a bit of reading, e.g. modal keys or navigating through isolated tabs
