        How to use
        ==========

           :align: right
           :alt: Example form
        
        After installation you can add a new content type to you site: the "*Signup Sheet*".
        
        Starting configuration in the edit form is only about general information about the event, like:
        
        * Max number of registrants (if any)
        * Waiting list size (if any)
        * Start/End date of the event
        * Start/End date of early bird phase
        * Registration deadline
        * ...much more
        
        After that your users can access a **subscription form**, but you can easily customize
        *how* the form looks like.
        
        Customizing the subscription form
        ---------------------------------
        
        This product is based on `PloneFormGen`__ so you can use the same form construction features.
        You have a great set of form fields available, but 3rd party products can enhance this list (for example:
        a captcha protection field could help).
        
        __ http://plone.org/products/ploneformgen
        
        The form is automatically generated with three core fields:
        
        * Name
        * Surname
        * Email
        
        The *email* field is recommended but you can freely change/delete them all and add much more fields.
        
        Whatever form you define, your users must fill the form to subscribe.
        
        Handling subscriptions
        ----------------------

           :align: right
           :alt: Editing a subscriber
        
        Every time a user fill the form, a "*registrant*" content is created inside the "*Registrants*" subsection of
        the form.
        The registrant is *real* working document that an administrator can edit later (we are using the poweful
        `uwosh.pfg.d2c`__ here).
        
        __ http://plone.org/products/uwosh.pfg.d2c
        
        For users able to manage the signup sheet an administrative view "*View Registrant*" is given.

           :align: center
           :alt: View Registrants
        
        From this view you can see the status of all subscriptions and confim them.
        Right now confirming a user subscription has only internal meaning and confirmed or unconfirmed users are not
        handled in different way.
        
        Other features
        --------------
        
        Notification system
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The Signup Sheet contains also two PloneFormGen mailer adapter, one for notification to the manager at every
        new subscription, another for notify the user itself after the subscription (for receive a confirmation of filled
        data).
        
        You can customize those adapters for fit your needs (new mail messages, notify additional users, ...).
        
        .. Note:: although both mailers are normal PloneFormGen items, the "*User notification mailer*" is
                  **disabled** by default. It's used in a special way and must stay disabled for proper working.
        
        Automatic notifications apart you can also use the "*Notify Registrants*" view, to send a custom message to
        all registrants (or to a part of them).

        Historical tribute to SignupSheet
        ---------------------------------
        
        Altough this product is using more recent Plone technologies, it's miming all the features of another product:
        `SignupSheet`__.
        
        __ http://plone.org/products/signupsheet
        
        The software stack used in the orginal product has become too old to be maintained anymore. We hope this new add-on
        will give same features and best flexibility.
