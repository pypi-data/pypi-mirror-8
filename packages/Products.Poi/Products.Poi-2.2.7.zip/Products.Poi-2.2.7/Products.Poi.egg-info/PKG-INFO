Description: Poi: A friendly issue tracker
        =============================
        
         by Martin Aspeli <optilude@gmx.net>
        
         current maintainer: Maurits van Rees <maurits@vanrees.org>
        
         Released under the GNU General Public License, version 2
         
        Poi is an issue tracker product for Plone. It has three overarching aims:
        
        - Provide the default tracker for open source software projects on
          http://plone.org
        
        - Be simple and attractive whilst providing the most commonly needed issue
          tracking functionality.
        
        - Optionally integrate with the PloneSoftwareCenter to allow
          individual products to have their own issue trackers
        
        Poi is not and will not be a track-anything-and-everything tracker, a help desk
        product or anything else. If Poi is too simple for your needs, you may want to
        look at something like PloneCollectorNG.
        
        Feedback is very welcome. 
        
        Please submit any bugs or feature requests at: 
            
            http://plone.org/products/poi/issues
            
        (Yes, this is a Poi tracker). Please do search the tracker first, so we can
        avoid unnecessary duplicates.
            
        See http://plone.org/products/poi for the latest release and the development 
        road map.
        
        
        Installation and dependencies
        -----------------------------
        
        Best is to use zc.buildout.  Just add Products.Poi to your eggs, rerun
        buildout and you are done.  Optionally add
        Products.PloneSoftwareCenter.
        
        Poi requires:
        
          - Plone 4; this version of Poi will *not* work with Plone 3.
        
          - DataGridField
        
          - AddRemoveWidget
        
          - collective.watcherlist
        
          - For PloneSoftwareCenter integration, PloneSoftwareCenter is
            required.  See http://plone.org/products/plonesoftwarecenter
            Tested with PloneSoftwareCenter 1.5.
        
        For new installations, install using Add/Remove Products as normal. If you want
        PloneSoftwareCenter configuration to be automatically configured, install PSC
        *first*.
        
        
        Upgrading
        ---------
        
        Re-install Poi from the Add/Remove Products control panel.  Some
        upgrade steps will be executed; these can also be found in the ZMI, in
        portal_setup, on the Upgrade tab, in case you need to run them again.
        Backup your Data.fs first before upgrading!
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add a Tracker, and use the "state" menu to open it for submissions. 
         
        The tracker front pages allows you to browse for issues by release,
        state or area, as well as search for issues. Note that if you are not
        tracking software releases, you can leave the list of "releases"
        empty, and organisation by release will be turned off. The fields for
        areas and issue types come pre-configured with simple values that
        presume you are tracking software bugs.  You can change these to
        whatever you want.
        
        Once you have set up the tracker, add Issues inside, and Responses
        inside Issues. Anyone can add responses to issues with the default
        workflow. Responses from tracker managers (as configured on the root
        tracker object) and the original submitter are colour coded to make
        them easier to pick out. When adding a response as a tracker manager,
        you can change the state, importance or assignment of an issue.
        
        If email notification is enabled in the root tracker object, managers
        will get an email when there are new issues and responses, optionally
        via a mailing list. Issue submitters will also get emails upon issue
        responses. Additionally, when an issue is marked as "resolved" by a
        tracker manager, the submitter will receive an email asking him or her
        to mark the issue as confirmed closed.
        
        To use with the PloneSoftwareCenter, install PSC and *then* install
        Poi. This will ensure PoiPscTracker is added to the list of allowed
        content types in portal_types/PSCProject. You can then add Trackers
        inside a project in the software center. The trackers will function in
        the same way as regular trackers, but will use releases from the
        software center project instead of a manually defined list.
        
        For a look at how the various workflow states of an issue are
        connected, take a look at the attachment added by bethor to this
        issue: http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/179
        
        
        Using HTML/kupu and other markups for issue text:
        -------------------------------------------------
        
         **Please see notes about migration above!**
        
        Before version 1.0b2 Poi used to support kupu/rich text fields with HTML in the
        issue and response body. This was removed in favour of "intelligenttext", a
        plain-text markup that preserves whitespace and makes links clickable.
        
        This was found to work very well on plone.org and for the type of simple 
        trackers that Poi was intended for. However, a lot of users wanted kupu back.
        
        To get kupu back, you will need to edit Poi/config.py::
        
          ISSUE_MIME_TYPES = ('text/x-web-intelligent', 'text/html')
          DEFAULT_ISSUE_MIME_TYPE = 'text/html'
        
        You may also need to re-install Poi, and perform an Archetypes schema update,
        by going to archetypes_tool, and the Schema Update tab in the ZMI.
        
        And you may need to remove some conditional expressions in the
        portal_javascripts to make sure all needed scripts load (at least for
        TinyMCE).
        
        Please note one **very important** thing:
        
        - If you upgrade Poi, you are likely to have to make this change again!

        Changelog for Poi
        =================
        
        
        2.2.7 (2014-09-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Refer to .png Plone images in css instead of .gif.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - When we go to search form, current filters are pre-selected.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Filled in missing translations for de and removed stale fuzzy entries
          [pilz]
        
        
        2.2.6 (2013-10-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Show technicians in the responsible managers list in the search
          form.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/266
          [maurits]
        
        - Sort the available releases of trackers in PloneSoftwareCenter by
          id, which means: by version.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix auto-recognized issue/revision links when displayed in the
          tracker log.  These would point outside of the tracker.  Now we pass
          the absolute url of the tracker.  Note that responses cache their
          rendered html text in a variable ``rendered_text``, which is only
          updated when you edit the response, so this may not have effect on
          existing responses.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/255
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix corner cases in recognizing links to issues and revisions.  Add
          the patterns for these two in ``config.py`` so they can be
          overridden.  Also add the template to use when recognizing a link to
          another issue there.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/262
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.2.5 (2013-08-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed mail templates styles for new issue and new response
          [cekk]
        
        - Some style fixes; removed all inline styles left, translated to
          CSS rules.
          [keul]
        
        2.2.4 (2013-07-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the text type selection for the tracker description.  Note:
          when editing and saving an existing tracker and it has html code in
          its description, you may get a validation error: "Mimetype text/html
          is not allowed."  In that case you need to edit the description and
          remove the html tags.
          [keul]
        
        - Some style fixes; removed inline styles.
          [keul]
        
        
        2.2.3 (2013-04-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Also allow text/plain for the details field.  This fixes a problem
          with Plone 4.3.
          [maurits]
        
        - Updated italian translation
          [keul]
        
        - Now supporting the "Site Administrator" role
          [keul]
        
        - Fix tracker security; issues inside private folder
          must not be visible to anonymous users
          [keul]
        
        
        2.2.2 (2013-04-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Show the 'Watch/Stop watching this tracker' button again.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed ``KeyError: portal`` on several pages for anonymous users.
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.2.1 (2013-03-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Issue search form criteria can be pre-selected from request.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Quick search and add issue button are now available on all pages.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Most metadata are now clickable links.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Added issue_portal_type parameter in IssueFolderView.  It is now
          possible to use a custom content type inherited from PoiIssue.
          [cedricmessiant]
        
        
        2.2 (2013-02-07)
        ----------------
        
        
        - Completed French translations.
          [cedricmessiant]
        
        - Store the watchers of a tracker in a lines field instead of
          annotations.  This way, you can edit them as Manager if that is
          needed.  Added an upgrade step to migrate all existing trackers.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed changes in a response that were being saved with a wrong id.
          This did not cause missing data, just a duplicate id in the response
          changes.  This is never shown in the UI, so should only be a problem
          for third party code that directly accesses this response data
          structure.
          https://github.com/collective/Products.Poi/issues/4
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.1.4 (2012-12-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix advanced search form not returning results unless both `Issue
          number` and `Submitter` were specified.
          [rpatterson]
        
        
        2.1.3 (2012-11-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed reinstall error.  Metadata would be missing in the catalog
          brains.
          [maurits]
        
        - Included Products.AddRemoveWidget and Products.DataGridField in configure.zcml
          [cedricmessiant]
        
        
        2.1.2 (2012-11-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed packaging error.
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.1.1 (2012-11-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Made compatible with Plone 4.3.  Lost compatibility with Plone 4.0.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix Unauthorized/"Insufficient Privileges" error under Plone 4.2.
          [rpatterson]
        
        
        2.1.0 (2012-06-28)
        ------------------
        
        - completed german translation [jensens]
        
        
        2.1.0b1 (2012-05-02)
        --------------------
        
        - Get rid of all code that still handled old PoiResponses.  If you
          still have those (meaning you were using Poi 1.1.x before this),
          then you must first update to version 2.0.x and run the upgrade
          steps.
          [maurits]
        
        - Add an uninstall method and profile, to clean up a bit more.  In
          addition to what the CMFQuickInstaller does, we remove our catalog
          columns and indexes, our skin layer from the skin selections, and
          our types from the parentMetaTypesNotToQuery in the
          navtree_properties.
          [maurits]
        
        - Refactored all email notifications to templates. This should make it
          easier to customize and translate.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed example link for collective changesets.
          [maurits]
        
        - When clicking on the suggested login button, show a popup.
          [maurits]
        
        - Removed htmlrender.py.
          [maurits]
        
        - Refactored the email notifications by creating a page template
          ``browser/poi_mail.pt`` and a css file ``skins/Poi/poi-email.css``
          and using that instead of hardcoded stuff in a python file
          ``htmlrender.py``.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/251
          [maurits]
        
        - Allow assigning portlets to trackers and issues.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/250
          [maurits]
        
        - Make sure the issue-info-box does not inherit a 100% width, as is the
          case on plone.org at the moment (6 September 2011), which is far too
          wide for this little box.
          See http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/249
          [Maurits]
        
        - Added MANIFEST.in file so that .mo translation files will be
          included in source distributions (with help from zest.releaser and
          zest.pocompile).
          Refs http://plone.org/products/poi/issues/248
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.0.2 (2011-04-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on Products.CMFPlone instead of Plone to improve Plone 4.1
          compatibility.
          [maurits]
        
        - Do not fail when rendering a response that has a text/x-html-safe
          mimetype or where the html transform returns nothing.  (Merged from
          1.2 branch.)
          [maurits]
        
        - Review French translations
          [toutpt]
        
        
        2.0.1 (2010-11-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Split profile registration and upgrade steps from configure.zcml
          into a new profiles.zcml as it is quite big already.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix: for the 'no change' label and input the ids were empty.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Removed our dependency on collective.autopermission, as its
          functionality is integrated in Zope 2.12 (Plone 4.0).
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.0 (2010-10-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Lower the minimum dependency on Products.AddRemoveWidget to 1.4.2
          again, as I had a report about a performance hit in 1.4.3 in corner
          cases not related to Poi itself; and 1.4.2 is fine really, though
          1.4.4 has a fix for Plone 4 in a part that Poi does not use.
          [maurits]
        
        - Do not advise users to click on 'search for issues' as that link is
          nowhere; instead it should be 'Advanced issue search'.
          [maurits]
