# NOTE: this imports the following submodules and then subclasses several classes
# importing is done via import_module rather than an ordinary import.
# The only reason for this is to hide the base classes from IDEs like PyCharm,
# so that those members/attributes don't show up in autocomplete,
# including all the built-in django model fields that an ordinary oTree programmer will never need or want.
# if this was a conventional Django project I wouldn't do it this way,
# but because oTree is aimed at newcomers who may need more assistance from their IDE,
# I want to try this approach out.
# this module is also a form of documentation of the public API.
