Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A PAS plugin to login into a Plone Site using Twitter. Provides the following features:
        
        * Log in to a Plone site through Twitter: when a user requests to log in to the Plone site he will be redirected to Twitter so that he provides the credentials there, then he will be redirected back to the Plone site and will be identified there.
        
        * The user will be a standard Plone user, so Roles or Group membership can be set.
        
        * Minimal user information is kept in Plone such as full name, screen-name Twitter ID and twitter photo of the user. This is kept to avoid permanent requests to Twitter API. This information is refreshed each time the user logs in to the site.
        
        
        Installation and getting started
        -----------------------------------
        
        Add `cs.auth.twitter` to your buildout.cfg's eggs list. It will install all required dependencies.
        
        You have to add a configuration similar to this to the `[instance]`
        section of your buildout file::
        
         zope-conf-additional =
            <product-config beaker>
                session type     file
                session.data_dir ${buildout:directory}/var/sessions/data
                session.lock_dir ${buildout:directory}/var/sessions/lock
                session.key      beaker.session
                session.secret   this-is-my-secret-${buildout:directory}
            </product-config>
        
        This is needed because we are using collective.beaker to handle Twitter login
        session information.
        
        Install the product in the Plone Control Panel. This will create a "Login with
        Twitter" action into the personal tools toolbar in Plone.
        
        
        Create a new Twitter app at https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new and fill in the
        required data in the plugin's control panel form.
