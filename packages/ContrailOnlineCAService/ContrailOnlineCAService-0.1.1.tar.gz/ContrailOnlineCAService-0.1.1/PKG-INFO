Description: Provides a simple web service interface to a Certificate Authority.  This is 
        suitable for use as a SLCS (Short-Lived Credential Service).
        
        The interface is implemented as a WSGI application which fronts a Certificate
        Authority.  The Certificate Authority is implemented with the ``ContrailCA``
        package also available from PyPI.
        
        Web service call can be made to request an X.509 certificate.  The web service 
        interface is RESTful and uses GET and POST operations.  The service should be 
        hosted over HTTPS.  Client authentication is configurable to the required means 
        using any WSGI-compatible filters including repoze.who.  An application is 
        included which  uses HTTP Basic Auth to pass username/password credentials.  
        SSL client-based authentication can also be used.  A client is available with 
        the ``ContrailOnlineCAClient`` package also available from PyPI.
        
        The code has been developed for the Contrail Project, http://contrail-project.eu/
