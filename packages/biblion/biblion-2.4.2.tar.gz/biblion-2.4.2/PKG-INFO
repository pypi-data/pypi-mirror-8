        Biblion was the eldarion.com blog which we've extracted and open sourced. It
        is currently positioned as being used for site/project blogs such as
        eldarion.com and eldarionproject.com. We intend for this app to replace the
        internal eldarion blog app once we've made it feature complete.
        
        
        Current features include:
        
         * support for multiple channels (e.g. technical vs business)
         * use of Creole as markup format
         * Atom and RSS feeds
         * previewing of blog posts before publishing
         * optional ability to announce new posts on twitter
