Second-order EAF KS-like two-sample two-sided test
==================================================

Usage: eaftest <fileA> <fileB>
       eaftest -i <indicators_file>

<fileA> and <fileB>: non-dominated sets of two-dimensional
                     objective vectors
<indicators_file>: point indicator file from the joint-eaf
                   computation

Current limitations: second-order only
                     maximum executions: 64 (32 + 32)
                     permutations: 10240 (fixed)
                     significance level: 0.05 (fixed)
