#Karta - tidy Python package for geospatial computation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/njwilson23/karta.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/njwilson23/karta)

*Karta* is a Leatherman for geographic analyses. *Karta* provides an lightweight
interface for solving problems in Python/Python3. It presents a simple and clean
vector and raster data types, a small selection of geographical analysis
functions, and the ability to read and write several useful formats.

Goals of *Karta* include exposing a simple and fast framework for spatial
analysis. *Karta* is under development and suggestions and pull requests are
welcome, particularly to improve format support and test coverage.

**Current projects:**
- test coverage
- documentation

## DOCUMENTATION
API documentation can be built by running `make` from the `doc/` directory. The
beginnings of a tutorial to introduce *Karta* are in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/njwilson23/karta/wiki/Tutorial).

##CONTENTS AT A GLANCE

- vector
    - guppy:        Vector geometry classes (e.g. `Point`, `Multipoint`, `Line`, `Polygon`) supporting the [Python \_\_geo\_interface\_\_](https://gist.github.com/sgillies/2217756)
    - gpx:          GPX class for parsing and constructing GPX eXchange files
    - geojson:      Classes and functions for reading and writing GeoJSON
    - shp\_funcs:   Shapefile-to-guppy conversions through _pyshp_ interface
    - xyfile:       ASCII table functions
    - quadtree:     QuadTree implementation
    - stats:        Geostatistical functions (experimental)

- raster
    - grid:         Basic Grid types, including `RegularGrid` and `WarpedGrid`
    - raster:       General purpose raster functions
    - aaigrid:      Grid subclass specifically for reading and writing ESRI ASCII grids
    - streamline:   Streamline calculation
    - flow:         Stream flow functions (experimental)

- crs : `CRS` and `CRSRegister` classes used throughout *Karta*

- tests : unit tests


##FORMATS

*Karta* provides a basic working interface to several of common file formats.
Currently partially-supported are:

- vector
    - GeoJSON (r,w)
    - ESRI Shapefiles via pyshp (r,w)
    - GPS eXchange (GPX) (r,w)
    - ASCII tables (XYZ) (r,w)
- raster
    - ESRI ASCII Grid (r,w)
    - GeoTiff through GDAL (r)
    - USGS DEM (WIP)

## INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install is to use `pip`.

To install the latest release from PyPI, run

    pip install karta

To build from source,

    git clone https://github.com/njwilson23/karta.git
    pip install -r karta/requirements.txt
    pip install karta/

## DEPENDENCIES

### Required

- Python 2.7+ or Python 3.2+
- numpy
- pyshp
- pyproj (for geodetic calculations)

### Optional

- cython
- gdal (for geotiff I/O)
- scipy

Cython is an optional dependency used to speed up select functions. In general,
enhanced-performance functions will then be called automatically when available,
otherwise *Karta* will fall back to numpy and pure-Python versions.

When installing from PyPI, C source code is provided and will be automatically
compiled if a suitable compiler is available.

## TESTING

To run all unit tests, execute

    python tests/runtests.py
