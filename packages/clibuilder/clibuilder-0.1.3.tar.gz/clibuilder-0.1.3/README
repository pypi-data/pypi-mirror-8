This module provides a class ```cli.CLI``` that simplifies writing Command Line Interfaces for applications. It uses the ```argparse``` module from the CPython standard library, which provides great help/error messaging, as well as argument validation. You can find a decorator-based alternative in ```flask.ext.script.Manager```, but here I've tried to emulate the ```argparse.ArgumentParser``` interface, with the bonus of no external dependencies.

### Example

See ```example.py``` for a great intro.
