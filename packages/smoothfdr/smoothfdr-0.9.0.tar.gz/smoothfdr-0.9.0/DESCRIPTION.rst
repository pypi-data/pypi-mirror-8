False Discovery Rate Smoothing
==============================

The smoothfdr package provides an implementation of false dicovery rate smoothing as presented in the paper by Tansey et al. (arxiv link).

The documentation is still being written. To-do list includes:

1) Basic usage

2) Examples

    - 2a) 1-d
    - 2b) 2-d (rectangular)
    - 2c) fMRI (non-rectangular)

All of these cases are covered by the code, but detailed examples still need to be written up.
