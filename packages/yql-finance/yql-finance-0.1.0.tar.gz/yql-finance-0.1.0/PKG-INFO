        How to use it?
        ==============
        You can use it to fetch data in one of two ways:
        
        ```python
        yql = YQL('AAPL', '2011-01-01', '2014-12-31')
        ```
        or
        ```python
        yql = YQL()
        yql.select('AAPL', '2011-01-01', '2014-12-31')
        ```
        
        Examples
        ===============
        
        1. First way:
        ```python
        from yql.api import YQL
        
        yql = YQL('AAPL', '2014-01-01', '2014-01-10')
        
        for item in yql:
            print item.get('date'), item.get('price')
        ```
        2. Second way:
        ```python
        from yql.api import YQL
        
        yql = YQL()
        
        yql.select('AAPL', '2014-01-01', '2014-01-10')
        
        for item in yql:
            print item.get('date'), item.get('price')
        ```
