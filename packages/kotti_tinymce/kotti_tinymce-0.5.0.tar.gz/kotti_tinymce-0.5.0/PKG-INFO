        =============
        
        TinyMCE plugins for Kotti.
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        To activate the kotti_tinymce add-on in your Kotti site, you need to
        add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste
        Deploy config.  If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option,
        add one.  The line in your ``[app:main]`` section could then look like
        this::
        
          kotti.configurators = kotti_tinymce.kotti_configure
        
        With this, you'll be able to use TinyMCE in your Kotti site.

        ChangeLog
        =========
        
        0.5.0
        -----
        
        - Revise templates to use Bootstrap 3.
          THIS IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE AND WILL BREAK KOTTI < 0.10!
        
        - Bundle our own TinyMCE instead of relying on ``js.tinymce``.  This allows
          full control over the plugins.
        
        - Publish ``kotti-tinymce`` as Bower package.  This is especially useful if
          you are developing a Kotti application and want to have full control over
          your static assets instead of relying on (often outdated or incomplete)
          ``js.whatever`` packages.  It also make upgrade much easier.

        - Added abiltiy to add alt text to images via kottiimage plugin.
