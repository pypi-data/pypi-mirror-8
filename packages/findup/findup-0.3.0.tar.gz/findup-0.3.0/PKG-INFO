        ## Introduction
        
        Find the first path matching a given pattern in the current working
        directory (or a given directory) or the nearest ancestor directory.  This
        project is (roughly) a python version of
        [node-findup-sync](https://github.com/cowboy/node-findup-sync).
        
        Why?  Applications, such as git, often use project configuration files found in
        the current directory or an ancestor directory.  The `findup` modules allows an
        application author to easily find these files or directories.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        The best way to install is probably to use pip:
        
            pip install findup
        
        Or you can clone and install findup from github:
        
            git clone https://github.com/todddeluca/python-findup.git
            cd python-findup
            python setup.py install
        
        ## Usage
        
        `pattern` is combined with the current working directory or an ancestor
        directory and passed to `glob.glob` to see if the pattern matches.  If it does,
        the first match is returned.  Pattern can contain some shell wildcard
        characters, like `?` and `*`.  See the python `glob` module for more details.
        
            findup.glob(pattern)
        
        To find the root dir of a git repository, when the current working directory is
        somewhere within the repository:
        
            os.path.dirname(findup.glob('.git'))
        
        Or more robustly, handling the case where the cwd is not within a git
        repository:
        
            path = findup.glob('.git')
            git_root = None if path is None or os.path.dirname(path)
