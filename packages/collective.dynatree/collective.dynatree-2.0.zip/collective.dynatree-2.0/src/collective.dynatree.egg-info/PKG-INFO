        ----------------
        2.0 (2014-10-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Several enhancements and minor bug fixes.
          [regebro]
        
        - Bunch of fixes for z3cform widget, example types for dx, integration with
          fixed tree vocabularies of ``collective.vdexvocabulary`` and more polishing.
          Updated to latest ``jquery.dynatree``. Some renamings (attention, imports are
          changing slightly).

        1.3.4 (2011-03-31)
        ------------------
        
        - for some cases we need to explicit iterate over .keys() - thanks to Jess Hix
          for the patch, jensens 2011-03-31
        
        ------------------
        1.3.3 (2011-03-14)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed JS bug with f****g IE. Ported solution used by hpeter at

        ------------------
        1.3.2 (2011-03-08)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed bug: css-registry merges css, so paths to skin were no longer relative.
          Adding the resource part helps here. jensens 2011-03-08
        
        ------------------
