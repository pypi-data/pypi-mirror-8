Description: 
        It often happens that you have non-Roman text data in Unicode, but
        you can't display it -- usually because you're trying to show it
        to a user via an application that doesn't support Unicode, or
        because the fonts you need aren't accessible. You could represent
        the Unicode characters as "???????" or "BAA0q0...", but
        that's nearly useless to the user who actually wants to read what
        the text says.
        
        What Unihandecode provides is a function, 'decode(...)' that
        takes Unihancode data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters 
        (i.e., the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F). 
        The representation is almost always an attempt at transliteration 
        -- i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by 
        the text in some other writing system.
        
        For example;
        >>>d = Unidecoder()
        >>>d.decode(u"\u5317\u4EB0")
        'Bei Jing'.
        d = Unidecoder(lang='ja')
        >>>d.decode(u"\u5317\u4EB0")
        'Pe King'
