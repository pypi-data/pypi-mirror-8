Description: This package is a straight-forward port of the functions ``hmc2.m`` and
        ``hmc2_opt.m`` from the
        `MCMCstuff <http://www.lce.hut.fi/research/mm/mcmcstuff/>`__ matlab
        toolbox written by Aki Vehtari. The code is originally based on the
        functions ``hmc.m`` from the `netlab
        toolbox <http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/netlab/index.php>`__ written by Ian
        T Nabney. The portion of algorithm involving "windows" is derived from
        the C code for this function included in the `Software for Flexible
        Bayesian
        Modeling <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/fbm.software.html>`__
        written by Radford Neal.
        
        The original Python `port <https://github.com/koepsell/pyhmc>`__ was
        made by Kilian Koepsell, and subsequently modernized by Robert T.
        McGibbon.
