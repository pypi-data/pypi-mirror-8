Description: JOTTA CLOUD CLIENT
        ==================
        
        A cli friendly sync client for `JottaCloud <http://jottacloud.com>`__.
        
        It will sync your directory tree with JottaCloud, just like the official
        client.
        
        **Note. This a third-party, not an official client.s**
        
        How to use it
        -------------
        
        Run ``jottacloudclientscanner.py`` at some interval:
        
        ::
        
            python jottacloudclientscanner.py <top dir of your local tree> <the mount point on jottacloud>
        
        The program expects to find ``JOTTACLOUD_USERNAME`` AND
        ``JOTTACLOUD_PASSWORD`` as variables in the running environment. So you
        might want to do
        
        ::
        
            export JOTTACLOUD_USERNAME=<username> JOTTACLOUD_PASSWORD=<password>
        
        But it's not finished!
        ======================
        
        But it's not very advanced!
        ===========================
        
        Geez, you should've added *super bright idea* already!
