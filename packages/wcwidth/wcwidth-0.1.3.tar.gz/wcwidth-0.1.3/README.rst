============
Introduction
============

This API is mainly for Terminal Emulator implementors -- any python program
that attempts to determine the printable width of a string on a Terminal.

It is certainly possible to use your Operating System's ``wcwidth()`` and
``wcswidth()`` calls if it is POSIX-conforming, but this would not be possible
on non-POSIX platforms, such as Windows, or for alternative Python
implementations, such as jython.

Furthermore, testing (`wcwidth-libc-comparator.py`_) has shown that libc
wcwidth() is particularly out of date on most operating systems, reporting -1
for a great many characters that are actually a displayable width of 1 or 2.

The most current release of this API is based from Unicode Standard release
_7.0.0_, dated 2014-02-28, 23:15:00 GMT [KW, LI]

Problem
-------

You may have noticed some characters especially Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean (collectively known as the *CJK Unified Ideographs*) consume more
than 1 terminal cell.

In python, if you ask for the length of the string, ``u'コンニチハ'``
(Japanese: Hello), it is correctly determined to be a length of **5**.

However, if you were to print this to a Terminal Emulator, such as xterm,
urxvt, Terminal.app, or PuTTY, it would consume **10** *cells* (columns) --
two for each symbol.

On an 80-wide terminal, the following would wrap along the margin, instead
of displaying it right-aligned as desired::

    >>> text = u'コンニチハ'
    >>> print(text.rjust(80))
                                                                                 コン
    ニチハ

Solution
--------

This API allows one to determine the printable length of these strings,
that the length of ``wcwidth(u'コ')`` is reported as ``2``, and
``wcswidth(u'コンニチハ')`` as ``10``.

This allows one to determine the printable effects of displaying *CJK*
characters on a terminal emulator.

Installation
------------

The stable version of this package is maintained on pypi, install using pip::

    pip install wcwidth

wcwidth, wcswidth
-----------------
Use ``wcwidth`` to determine the length of a single character,
and ``wcswidth`` to determine the length of a string of characters.

To Display ``u'コンニチハ'`` right-adjusted on screen of 80 columns::

    >>> from wcwidth import wcswidth
    >>> text = u'コンニチハ'
    >>> print(u' ' * (80 - wcswidth(text)) + text)
                                                                           コンニチハ


Values
------

See the docstring for ``wcwidth()``, general overview of return values:

   - ``-1``: indeterminate, such as combining_ characters.

   - ``0``: do not advance the cursor, such as NULL.

   - ``2``: East_Asian_Width property values W and F (Wide and Full-width).

   - ``1``: all others.

``wcswidth()`` simply returns the sum of all values along a string, or
``-1`` if it has occurred for any value returned by ``wcwidth()``.

Developing

Updating Tables
---------------

The command ``python setup.py update`` will fetch the following resources:

    - http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/EastAsianWidth.txt
    - http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/extracted/DerivedCombiningClass.txt

Generating the table files `wcwidth/table_wide.py`_ and `wcwidth/table_comb.py`_.

wcwidth.c
---------

This code was originally derived directly from C code of the same name,
whose latest version is available at: `wcwidth.c`_ And is authored by
Markus Kuhn -- 2007-05-26 (Unicode 5.0)

Any subsequent changes were done by directly testing against the various libc
implementations of POSIX-compliant Operating Systems, such as Mac OSX, Linux,
and OpenSolaris.

Examples
--------

This library is used in:

- `jquast/blessed`_, a simplified wrapper around curses.

- `jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit`_, a Library for building powerful interactive command lines in Python.

Additional tools for displaying and testing wcwidth is found in the ``bin/``
folder of this project (github link: `wcwidth/bin`_). They are not distributed
as a script or part of the module.

Todo
----

It is my wish that `combining`_ characters are understood. Currently,
any string containing combining characters will always return ``-1``.
