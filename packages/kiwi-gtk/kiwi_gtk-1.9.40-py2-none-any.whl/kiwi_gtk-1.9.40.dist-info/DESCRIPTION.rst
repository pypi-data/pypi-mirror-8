Kiwi is a framework and a set of enhanced PyGTK widgets designed to
make building programs with graphical interfaces both easy to write
and easy to maintain.

Kiwi consists of a set of classes and wrappers for PyGTK that were
developed to provide a sort of framework for applications. Fully
object-oriented, and roughly Smalltalk's MVC, Kiwi provides a simple,
practical way to build forms, windows and widgets that transparently
access and display your object data.

Kiwi is inspired by Allen Holub's Visual Proxy.
