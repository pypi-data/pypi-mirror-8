"""Common fixtures with minimal constraints on the test class used.

A common pattern in TestCase is to add fixtures in the base class so they are
accessible to all tests. This pollutes the base classes with methods or
attributes not used by most of the tests.

Fixtures are better used via composition. But requiring an additional
'.fixtures.feature_x.attribute_y' make them harder to use.

We use a middle ground here by just joining a simpler (and a bit surprising at
first) syntax and using python's ability to handle arbitrary attributes.

Apart from that modest invasise use of test objects namespace, the only
constraint is that the test object supports the 'addCleanup' and the most usual
assertX methods. Since 'addCleanup' is provided by unittest.TestCase itself,
this is a light constraint, most python test frameworks inheriting from it.

The benefit is that these fixtures can be used on any TestCase class without
requiring inheritance which can then be used for other needs without
interferences.
