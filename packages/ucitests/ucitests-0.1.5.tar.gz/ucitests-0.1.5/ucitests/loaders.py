"""Load tests from a file system tree.

Python tests themselves are generally organized as a subtree of a python
module.

There is a one to one relationship between a source file and a python module
as well as between a directory and a python package.

In the most common cases, loading all the tests for a given package is just
scanning the file system recursively from the package root, importing every
python file and loading the tests defined there if any. By default,
uci-tests will load all the tests in packages existing in the current
directory.

Alternatively, the package root can be obtained from an importable module.

Yet, some tests are not written in python and have different loading strategies
(including file/directory name matching). Even some python packages or even
just scripts may want to change this policy.

The Loader.SubLoader() method is aimed at making these policy changes as
easy as possible at any point in the python package hierarchy traversal.

Relying on the load_tests protocol, each python package or module can define
how the tests in a given subtree (down to a single module) should be loaded.
So an arbitrary tree containing tests can be populated with __init__.py files
to change the loading policy for specific subtrees. This applies equally weel
to python tests or any arbitrary kind of test (the latter requires subclassing
Loader to load the tests from the files themselves though ;).
