        Format-Transforming Encryption (FTE) is a cryptographic primitive explored in the paper *Protocol Misidentiﬁcation Made Easy with Format-Transforming Encryption* [1]. FTE allows a user to specify the format of their ouput ciphertexts using regular expressions. The libfte library implements the primitive presented in [1].
        
        If you are interested in the *proxy system* that uses FTE to bypass DPI systems, please see fteproxy (https://github.com/kpdyer/fteproxy).
