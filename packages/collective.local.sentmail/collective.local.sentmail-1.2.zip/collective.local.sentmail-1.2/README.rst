INTRODUCTION
------------

This module creates a "Sent mails" folder in your portal root. Each time a IMailSentEvent is launched, it creates a SentMail item in this folder with the event's attributes (subject, body and recipients).

Sent mails are visible only by their owner (the mail's sender) and editable by nobody.

A IMailSentEvent implementation example can be found in collective.local.sendto package.
