      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Description: Docker-Registry
        ===============
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/docker/docker-registry.png)](https://travis-ci.org/docker/docker-registry)
        
        About this document
        ===================
        
        As the documentation evolves with different registry versions, be sure that before reading any further you:
        
         * check which version of the registry you are running
         * switch to the corresponding tag to access the README that matches your product version
        
        The stable, released version is the [0.9.0 tag](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry/tree/0.9.0).
        
        Please also have a quick look at the [FAQ](FAQ.md) before reporting bugs.
        
        Quick start
        ===========
        
        The fastest way to get running:
        
         * [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation)
         * run the registry: `docker run -p 5000:5000 registry`
        
        That will use the [official image from the Docker hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/registry/).
        
        Here is a slightly more complex example that launches a registry on port 5000, using an Amazon S3 bucket to store images with a custom path, and enables the search endpoint:  
        
        ```
        docker run \
                 -e SETTINGS_FLAVOR=s3 \
                 -e AWS_BUCKET=mybucket \
                 -e STORAGE_PATH=/registry \
                 -e AWS_KEY=myawskey \
                 -e AWS_SECRET=myawssecret \
                 -e SEARCH_BACKEND=sqlalchemy \
                 -p 5000:5000 \
                 registry
        ```
        
        
        Configuration mechanism overview
        ================================
        
        By default, the registry will use the [config_sample.yml](config/config_sample.yml) configuration to start.
        
        Individual configuration options from that file may be overridden using environment variables. Example: `docker run -e STORAGE_PATH=/registry`.
        
        You may also use different "flavors" from that file (see below).
        
        Finally, you can use your own configuration file (see below).
        
        
        Configuration flavors
        =====================
        
        The registry can be instructed to use a specific flavor from a configuration file.
        
        This mechanism lets you define different running "mode" (eg: "development", "production" or anything else).
        
        In the `config_sample.yml` file, you'll see several sample flavors:
        
        1. `common`: used by all other flavors as base settings
        1. `local`: stores data on the local filesystem
        1. `s3`: stores data in an AWS S3 bucket
        1. `ceph-s3`: stores data in a Ceph cluster via a Ceph Object Gateway, using the S3 API
        1. `azureblob`: stores data in an Microsoft Azure Blob Storage ([(docs)](ADVANCED.md))
        1. `dev`: basic configuration using the `local` flavor
        1. `test`: used by unit tests
        1. `prod`: production configuration (basically a synonym for the `s3` flavor)
        1. `gcs`: stores data in Google cloud storage
        1. `swift`: stores data in OpenStack Swift
        1. `glance`: stores data in OpenStack Glance, with a fallback to local storage
        1. `glance-swift`: stores data in OpenStack Glance, with a fallback to Swift
        1. `elliptics`: stores data in Elliptics key/value storage
        
        You can define your own flavors by adding a new top-level yaml key.
        
        To specify which flavor you want to run, set the `SETTINGS_FLAVOR`
        environment variable: `export SETTINGS_FLAVOR=dev`
        
        The default flavor is `dev`.
        
        NOTE: it's possible to load environment variables from within the config file
        with a simple syntax: `_env:VARIABLENAME[:DEFAULT]`. Check this syntax
        in action in the example below...
        
        
        #### Example config
        
        ```yaml
        
        common: &common
            standalone: true
            loglevel: info
            search_backend: "_env:SEARCH_BACKEND:"
            sqlalchemy_index_database:
                "_env:SQLALCHEMY_INDEX_DATABASE:sqlite:////tmp/docker-registry.db"
        
        prod:
            <<: *common
            loglevel: warn
            storage: s3
            s3_access_key: _env:AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY
            s3_secret_key: _env:AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY
            s3_bucket: _env:AWS_S3_BUCKET
            boto_bucket: _env:AWS_S3_BUCKET
            storage_path: /srv/docker
            smtp_host: localhost
            from_addr: docker@myself.com
            to_addr: my@myself.com
        
        dev:
            <<: *common
            loglevel: debug
            storage: local
            storage_path: /home/myself/docker
        
        test:
            <<: *common
            storage: local
            storage_path: /tmp/tmpdockertmp
        ```
        
        
        
        Available configuration options
        ===============================
        
        When using the `config_sample.yml`, you can pass all options through as environment variables. See [`config_sample.yml`](config/config_sample.yml) for the mapping.
        
        ## General options
        
        1. `loglevel`: string, level of debugging. Any of python's
           [logging](http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) module levels:
           `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` or `critical`
        1. `debug`: boolean, make the `/_ping` endpoint output more useful information, such as library versions and host information.
        1. `storage_redirect`: Redirect resource requested if storage engine supports
           this, e.g. S3 will redirect signed URLs, this can be used to offload the
           server.
        1. `boto_host`/`boto_port`: If you are using `storage: s3` the
           [standard boto config file locations](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html#details)
           (`/etc/boto.cfg, ~/.boto`) will be used.  If you are using a
           *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store (such as Ceph), in one of the boto config files'
           `[Credentials]` section, set `boto_host`, `boto_port` as appropriate for the
           service you are using. Alternatively, set `boto_host` and `boto_port` in the config file.
        
        ### Authentication options
        
        1. `standalone`: boolean, run the server in stand-alone mode. This means that
           the Index service on index.docker.io will not be used for anything. This
           implies `disable_token_auth`.
        
        1. `index_endpoint`: string, configures the hostname of the Index endpoint.
           This is used to verify passwords of users that log in. It defaults to
           https://index.docker.io. You should probably leave this to its default.
        
        1. `disable_token_auth`: boolean, disable checking of tokens with the Docker
           index. You should provide your own method of authentication (such as Basic
           auth).
        
        ### Search-engine options
        
        The Docker Registry can optionally index repository information in a
        database for the `GET /v1/search` [endpoint][search-endpoint].  You
        can configure the backend with a configuration like:
        
        The `search_backend` setting selects the search backend to use.  If
        `search_backend` is empty, no index is built, and the search endpoint always
        returns empty results.
        
        1. `search_backend`: The name of the search backend engine to use.
           Currently supported backends are:
           1. `sqlalchemy`
        
        If `search_backend` is neither empty nor one of the supported backends, it
        should point to a module.
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        common:
          search_backend: foo.registry.index.xapian
        ```
        
        In this case, the module is imported, and an instance of its `Index`
        class is used as the search backend.
        
        #### sqlalchemy
        
        Use [SQLAlchemy][] as the search backend.
        
        1. `sqlalchemy_index_database`: The database URL passed through to
           [create_engine][].
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        common:
          search_backend: sqlalchemy
          sqlalchemy_index_database: sqlite:////tmp/docker-registry.db
        ```
        
        On initialization, the `SQLAlchemyIndex` class checks the database
        version.  If the database doesn't exist yet (or does exist, but lacks
        a `version` table), the `SQLAlchemyIndex` creates the database and
        required tables.  To avoid several Gunicorn workers racing to create
        the database, you should launch your registry with
        [--preload][gunicorn-preload].  For example:
        
            $ docker run -e GUNICORN_OPTS='[--preload]' -p 5000:5000 registry
        
        ### Mirroring Options
        
        All mirror options are placed in a `mirroring` section.
        
        1. `mirroring`:
          1. `source`:
          1. `source_index`:
          1. `tags_cache_ttl`:
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        common:
          mirroring:
            source: https://registry-1.docker.io
            source_index: https://index.docker.io
            tags_cache_ttl: 172800 # 2 days
        ```
        
        ### Cache options
        
        It's possible to add an LRU cache to access small files. In this case you need
        to spawn a [redis-server](http://redis.io/) configured in
        [LRU mode](http://redis.io/topics/config). The config file "config_sample.yml"
        shows an example to enable the LRU cache using the config directive `cache_lru`.
        
        Once this feature is enabled, all small files (tags, meta-data) will be cached
        in Redis. When using a remote storage backend (like Amazon S3), it will speed
        things up dramatically since it will reduce roundtrips to S3.
        
        All config settings are placed in a `cache` or `cache_lru` section.
        
        1. `cache`/`cache_lru`:
          1. `host`: Host address of server
          1. `port`: Port server listens on
          1. `password`: Authentication password
        
        
        
        ## Storage options
        
        `storage` selects the storage engine to use. The registry ships with two storage engine by default (`file` and `s3`).
        
        If you want to find other (community provided) storages: `pip search docker-registry-driver`
        
        To use and install one of these alternate storages:
        
         * `pip install docker-registry-driver-NAME`
         * in the configuration set `storage` to `NAME`
         * add any other storage dependent configuration option to the conf file
         * review the storage specific documentation for additional dependency or configuration instructions.
        
         Currently, we are aware of the following storage drivers:
        
          * [azure](https://github.com/ahmetalpbalkan/docker-registry-driver-azure)
          * [elliptics](https://github.com/noxiouz/docker-registry-driver-elliptics)
          * [swift](https://github.com/bacongobbler/docker-registry-driver-swift)
          * [gcs](https://github.com/dmp42/docker-registry-driver-gcs)
          * [glance](https://github.com/dmp42/docker-registry-driver-glance)
        
        ### storage: file
        
        1. `storage_path`: Path on the filesystem where to store data
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        local:
          storage: file
          storage_path: /mnt/registry
        ```
        
        #### Persistent storage
        If you use any type of local store along with a registry running within a docker
        remember to use a data volume for the `storage_path`. Please read the documentation
        for [data volumes](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/working_with_volumes/) for more information.
        
        Example:
        
        ```
        docker run -p 5000 -v /tmp/registry:/tmp/registry registry
        ```
        
        ### storage: s3
        AWS Simple Storage Service options
        
        1. `s3_access_key`: string, S3 access key
        1. `s3_secret_key`: string, S3 secret key
        1. `s3_bucket`: string, S3 bucket name
        1. `s3_region`: S3 region where the bucket is located
        1. `s3_encrypt`: boolean, if true, the container will be encrypted on the
              server-side by S3 and will be stored in an encrypted form while at rest
              in S3.
        1. `s3_secure`: boolean, true for HTTPS to S3
        1. `boto_bucket`: string, the bucket name for *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store
        1. `boto_host`: string, host for *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store
        1. `boto_port`: for *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store
        1. `boto_debug`: for *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store
        1. `boto_calling_format`: string, the fully qualified class name of the boto calling format to use when accessing S3 or a *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store
        1. `storage_path`: string, the sub "folder" where image data will be stored.
        
        Example:
        ```yaml
        prod:
          storage: s3
          s3_region: us-west-1
          s3_bucket: acme-docker
          storage_path: /registry
          s3_access_key: AKIAHSHB43HS3J92MXZ
          s3_secret_key: xdDowwlK7TJajV1Y7EoOZrmuPEJlHYcNP2k4j49T
        ```
        
        Your own config
        ===============
        
        Start from a copy of [config_sample.yml](config/config_sample.yml).
        
        Then, start your registry with a mount point to expose your new configuration inside the container (`-v /home/me/myfolder:/registry-conf`), and point to it using the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG` environment variable:
        
        ```
        sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 -v /home/me/myfolder:/registry-conf -e DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG=/registry-conf/mysuperconfig.yml registry
        ```
