`django-anysign` is a Django application to manage online signature in a
generic way.

Its goal is to provide a consistent API whatever the signature implementation.
So that, using `django-anysign`, you can easily switch from one signature
backend to another, or use several backends at once.


**************
Project status
**************

`django-anysign` is under active development. The project is not mature yet,
but authors already use it! It means that, while API and implementation may
change (improve!) a bit, authors do care of the changes.

Also, help is welcome! Feel free to report issues, request features or
refactoring!
