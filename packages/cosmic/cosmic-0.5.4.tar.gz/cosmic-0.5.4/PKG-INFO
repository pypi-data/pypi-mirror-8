        Version 0.5.4
        -------------
        
        (bugfix release, released on November 24th, 2014)
        
        - Fix ImportError related to last fix.
        
        Version 0.5.3
        -------------
        
        (bugfix release, released on November 24th, 2014)
        
        - Documentation: note that Cosmic uses an out-of-date version of Teleport.
        - Make it possible to install Teleport side-by-side by using a packaged copy.
        
        Version 0.5.2
        -------------
        
        (bugfix release, released on September 14th, 2014)
        
        - Fix bug in link representation, foreign links were represented as URLs of
          the same model.
        - Avoid reraising exceptions in http module to preserve original stack traces.
        
        Version 0.5.1
        -------------
        
        (bugfix release, released on September 12th, 2014)
        
        - Wrote documentation for the ``cosmic.globals`` module.
        - Implemented ``cosmic.globals.thread_local_middleware``.
        - Now the server doesn't force the creation of a thread-local on every request,
          it checks if one exists already. This allows using the middleware explicitly.
        
        Version 0.5.0
        -------------
        
        Released on September 10th, 2014
        
        - ``cosmic.Link`` type's JSON form is a string containing a URL, the "href"
          part was moved into ``cosmic.BaseRepresentation``. This makes the Link type
          friendlier for actions.
        
        Version 0.4.2
        -------------
        
        (bugfix release, released on August 25st, 2014)
        
        - Actions with no accepts or returns parameters broke.
        - Move API object storage (``cosmos``) out of thread-locals. This broke Cosmic
          in multi-threaded environments.
        - Let ``API.run`` accept ``debug`` parameter.
        - Changed ``Server.unhandled_exception_hook`` behavior:
           - Pass request object as second parameter.
           - Don't call it when ``Server.debug`` is true.
        - New thread-local API:
           - ``SafeGlobal`` gone in favor of ``SwappableDict`` and ``ThreadLocalDict``
           - Swapping API instead of stack API.
           - ``thread_local`` context manager takes care of cleaning up.
        
        Version 0.4.1
        -------------
        
        (bugfix release, released on August 21st, 2014)
        
        - Fixed ``cosmic.client.ClientLoggingMixin`` so that the ``log`` value is JSON
          serializable and the headers are represented consistently by lists of tuples.
        - Added CHANGES file
        - Improved ``long_description`` for PyPI
