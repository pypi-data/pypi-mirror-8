        .. topic:: Summary
        
           This package provides a Plone interface to the event search offered by 
           `InfoWeb Weiterbildung <http://www.iwwb.de/>`_. 
           It makes use of their web interfaces described at http://www.iwwb.de/wss/sucheIWWBServer.php 
           See `IWWB credits <http://www.iwwb.de/weiterbildung.html?seite=15>`_ for more information about the
           content provider.
        
        This package will be useful mostly to German users, as it explicitly targets a German site.
        
        An example of where this package is used (with further UI customizations) can be seen on the German site `gefaehrdungsbeurteilung.de <http://www.gefaehrdungsbeurteilung.de/de/service/fort-und-weiterbildungsangebote>`_.
