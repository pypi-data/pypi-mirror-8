Description: =============================
        Tugboat Pull Request Explorer
        =============================
        
        Tugboat is a command line tool for exploring open pull requests on
        Github or Github Enterprise, using the Github API.  It generates a
        report of all open pull requests for all the repositories it was
        requested to examine, sorted by the pull request's last update time.
        Each pull request is listed with a link to the pull request, and an
        indicator as to whether the pull request is mergeable.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Tugboat uses ``cli_tools``, and so provides extensive help text,
        accessible by using the "--help" argument.  The primary arguments it
        needs have to do with authenticating to Github (see the help for
        "--username", "--password", and "--github-url"; note that tugboat will
        prompt for a password if none is provided).
        
        Tugboat also must be told which repositories to examine; this is done
        by passing one or more of the "--repo", "--user", or "--org" options.
        (Note that tugboat will generate an empty report if none of these
        options are passed.)  Any mix of these options may be used; tugboat
        will explore all listed repositories, and all repositories it can see
        under the listed users or organizations.
