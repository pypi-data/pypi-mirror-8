Django Groups Manager
=====================

Django Groups Manager allows to manage groups based on `django-mptt <https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt>`_.

The application offers three main classes: `Group`, `Member` and `GroupMember`.
It's possible to *map* groups and members with Django's auth models, in order to use external applcations such `django-guardian <https://github.com/lukaszb/django-guardian>`_ to handle permissions.

The basic idea of Groups is that each `Group` instance could have a `Group` instance as parent (this relation is managed via django-mptt).
