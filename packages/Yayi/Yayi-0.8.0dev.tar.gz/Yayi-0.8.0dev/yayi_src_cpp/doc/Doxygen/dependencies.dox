@page install_numpy Numpy
<a href="http://numpy.scipy.org">Numpy</a> is a Python package delivering highly optimised mathematical operations on array, 
matrices, etc. Yayi is able to import/export images from/to Numpy N dimensional array format, which then can be processed by Numpy or any Python 
package expecting a Numpy array. 

Installing Numpy is easy, except on MacOSX:
- On Ubuntu: this is quite easily done with the package manager. 
- On Windows: download the self-runnable package corresponding to your Python installation (from the Numpy website) and run it.
- On Mac OSX: to the author knowledge, the Numpy package is available only for official Python installation (from 
<a href"http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>), 
and not for the flavour of Python coming with Mac OSX. Once the official Python distribution installed, installing Numpy is straightfoward.

See @ref configure_numpy for enabling Numpy during the build of Yayi.
