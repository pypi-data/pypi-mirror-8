@section wiy What is Yayi?
 Yayi is a open-source image processing framework, which particularly focuses on Mathematical Morphology operators. It is released under the very
 permissive Boost license. 
 The core of Yayi is entirely written in C++, mainly using templatized code and metaprogramming, which enables a high level of genericity. It implements some of the main concepts
 of Mathematical Morphology into an efficient and proven design. 
    
 Yayi aims at providing robust, efficient and flexible algorithms for image analysis, but also reference algorithms for Mathematical Morphology.
    
 Among its main features, one can cite:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Multidimensional and multispectral image processing and MM structures (coordinates and pixels are templatized over their type respectively)</li>
     <li>Algorithms are written in a multidimensional and multispectral fashion (orders are parameters)</li>
     <li>Classical useful structures are included: graphs, trees, histograms, ...</li>
     <li>Several types of structuring elements are provided: compile-time SE, runtime SE, functional SE, ...</li>
     <li>Yayi includes a dispatching mechanism for creating compiled libraries over a large combinations of the templates input types</li>
   </ul>
