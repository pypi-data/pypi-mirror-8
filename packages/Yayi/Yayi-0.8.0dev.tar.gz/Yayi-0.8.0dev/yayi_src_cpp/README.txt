Yayi is a open-source image processing framework, which particularly focuses on Mathematical Morphology operators. It is released under the very
permissive Boost license. 
The core of Yayi is entirely written in C++, mainly using templatized code and metaprogramming, which enables a high level of genericity. It implements some of the main concepts
of Mathematical Morphology into an efficient and proven design.
