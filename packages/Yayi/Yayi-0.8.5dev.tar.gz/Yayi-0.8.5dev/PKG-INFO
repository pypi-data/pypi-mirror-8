Description: Yayi
        ====
        
        
        Image processing and mathematical morphology python bindings.
        
        
        Yayi is a open-source image processing framework which particularly focuses on Mathematical Morphology operators. 
        It is released under the very permissive Boost license. 
        
        The core of Yayi is entirely written in C++, mainly using templatized code which enables a high level of 
        genericity. It implements some of the main concepts of Mathematical Morphology into an efficient and proven design. 
        Yayi aims at providing robust, efficient and flexible algorithms for image analysis, but also reference algorithms 
        for Mathematical Morphology.
        
        The python interface provides a simple way for using the main notions and functions of mathematical morphology. 
        The export uses the boost.python framework.
        
        The whole project uses `cmake`_ for building. Some bindings with `setup.py` are being developed in order to be able 
        to just `pip install yayi`.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Yayi needs `boost`_, `cmake`_ and a decent C++ compiler to build. You should install those tools in your system, preferably
        using your package manager.
        
        .. warning:: as soon as you build and install Yayi, Yayi becomes dependent on the `boost` package. If you upgrade `boost`
           to a new version, then it might break Yayi. As a matter of fact, python package management does not communicate
           with the /native/ package management of your operating system.  
           
        .. _boost: http://www.boost.org
        
        .. _cmake: http://www.cmake.org
        
        .. note:: the interface is still a bit clumpsy and is about to change. Your feedbacks are welcome!
        
        .. note:: some of the dependencies are shipped with Yayi directly, but on some platforms (Linux) the dependencies provided
                  by the package manager are preferred.
        
        Linux Ubuntu
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Ubuntu is shipped with its own package manager, and it is straightforward to install packages, though you
        need administrative privileges.
        
        To install the dependencies of Yayi, just type in a Terminal:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
          sudo apt-get install boost, cmake, python-numpy, libjpeg8-dev, zlib1g-dev, libpng12-dev, libtiff4-dev
          sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
        
        
        and then
        
        .. code:: shell
        
          pip install Yayi==0.8.2dev
        
        
        Then 
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from Yayi.common import YAYI
           YAYI.IO.readPNG('my/png/file.png")
           
        should work.
        
        
        OSX
        ~~~
        On OSX, a convenient package manager is `brew`_ 
        
        .. _brew: http://brew.sh/
        
        To install the dependencies, just type in a Terminal:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
          brew install boost
          brew install cmake
        
        
        and then
        
        .. code:: shell
        
          pip install numpy
          pip install Yayi==0.8.2dev
        
        
        Then 
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from Yayi.common import YAYI
           YAYI.IO.readPNG('my/png/file.png")
           
        should work.
        
        .. note:: currently not using the HDF5 extensions.
