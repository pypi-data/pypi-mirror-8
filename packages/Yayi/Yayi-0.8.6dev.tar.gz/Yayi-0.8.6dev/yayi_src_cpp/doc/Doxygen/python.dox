@page install_python Python
There is no need to present <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. Installing Python is a routine, however there is one thing to care about under MacOSX. 
As pointed out in @ref compil_boost "here", if you have installed an other version of Python than the one shipped with your OS, you have to check carefully 
if this version you installed is properly used by your toolchain and by cmake. It is possible to check this by inspecting the outputs given by 
cmake during the configuration. You should see something like

@code{bash}
-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpython2.7.dylib 
-- Found PythonInterp: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python (found version "2.7.2")
@endcode

Sometime, unfortunately more often than expected, the default dylib at <b>/usr/lib</b> is not properly updated during the installation of the official Python. 
This will result in wonderful and unexplainable crashes. 

@code{bash}
otool -v -L PATH_TO_COMPILATION/YayiCommonPython.so
@endcode

In order to replace the Apple Python library by the official one, you may type (supposing you have Python 2.7):
@code{bash}
sudo mv /usr/lib/libpython2.7.dylib /usr/lib/libpython2.7_apple.dylib
sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib /usr/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
@endcode
