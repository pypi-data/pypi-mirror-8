Description: Django Async is an asynchronous execution queue for Django with proper
        database transaction management.
        
        Building a database backed task queue is a fairly trivial thing, but
        getting the database transactions exactly right is no simple matter.

        -----------------------------
        
        Job cancellation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        There is now a separate ``cancelled`` field on jobs which can be used to
        mark those which are no longer to be run.
        
        Groups
        ~~~~~~
        
        There is now an optional job grouping in ``async.models.Group``. Jobs
        can be placed into a group so that related jobs can be tracked together.
        
        Doing development
        =================
        
        *This project uses git flow. Don't forget to do ``git flow init -d``*
        
        To create virtual environments for running the tests you can execute
        ``test-projects/make-virtual-environments``. To run the tests execute
        ``runtests``.
