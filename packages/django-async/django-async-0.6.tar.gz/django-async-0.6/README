Django Async is an asynchronous execution queue for Django with proper
database transaction management.

Building a database backed task queue is a fairly trivial thing, but
getting the database transactions exactly right is no simple matter.

Usage and documentation
=======================

All documentation can be found at http://www.kirit.com/Django%20Async

New in the development branch
-----------------------------

Job cancellation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is now a separate ``cancelled`` field on jobs which can be used to
mark those which are no longer to be run.

Groups
~~~~~~

There is now an optional job grouping in ``async.models.Group``. Jobs
can be placed into a group so that related jobs can be tracked together.

Doing development
=================

*This project uses git flow. Don't forget to do ``git flow init -d``*

To create virtual environments for running the tests you can execute
``test-projects/make-virtual-environments``. To run the tests execute
``runtests``.
