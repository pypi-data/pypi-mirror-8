.. module:: pulsar

=====================
Design
=====================

Pulsar implements two layers of components on top of python :mod:`asyncio`
module:

* :ref:`The actor layer <design-actor>` provides parallel execution in
  processes and threads and uses the :mod:`asyncio` module
  as building block.
* The second layer, built on top of the first one, is based on the higher level
  :class:`.Application` class.

.. _async-object:

Async Objects
=====================
Introduced in pulsar 0.8, an asynchronous object is any instance which exposes
the :attr:`~.AsyncObject._loop` attribute.
This attribute is the :ref:`event loop <asyncio-event-loop>` where
the instance performs its asynchronous operations, whatever they may be.

For example this is a class for valid async objects::

    from pulsar import get_event_loop, new_event_loop


    class SimpleAsyncObject:

        def __init__(self, loop=None):
            self._loop = loop or get_event_loop() or new_event_loop()

Properties:

* Several classes in pulsar are async objects, for example: :class:`.Actor`,
  :class:`.Connection`, :class:`.ProtocolConsumer`, :class:`.Store`
  and so forth
* A :class:`~asyncio.Future` is an async object
* However an async object **is not** necessarily a :class:`~asyncio.Future`
* When they use and :func:`.task` decorators for their methods,
  :attr:`~.AsyncObject._loop` attribute is used to run the method
* Pulsar provides the :class:`.AsyncObject` signature class,
  however it is not a requirement to derive from it

.. note::

    An async object can also run its asynchronous methods in a synchronous
    fashion. To do that, one should pass a bright new event loop during
    initialisation. Check :ref:`synchronous components <tutorials-synchronous>`
    for further details.


.. _design-actor:

Actors
=================

An :class:`.Actor` is the atom of pulsar's concurrent computation,
they do not share state between them, communication is achieved via asynchronous
:ref:`inter-process message passing <tutorials-messages>`,
implemented using the standard python socket library. A pulsar actor can be
process based as well as thread based and can perform one or many activities.

The theory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The actor model is the cornerstone of the Erlang programming language.
Python has very few implementation and all of them seem quite limited in scope.

.. epigraph::

    The Actor model in computer science is a mathematical model of concurrent
    computation that treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent
    digital computation: in response to a message that it receives, an actor
    can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and
    determine how to respond to the next message received.

    -- Wikipedia

**Actor's properties**

* Each actor has its own ``process`` (not intended as an OS process) and they
  don't shares state between them.
* Actors can change their own states.
* Actors can create other actors and when they do that they receive back the new actor address.
* Actors exchange messages in an asynchronous fashion.

**Why would one want to use an actor-based system?**

* No shared memory and therefore locking is not required.
* Race conditions greatly reduced.
* It greatly simplify the control flow of a program, each actor has its own process (flow of control).
* Easy to distribute, across cores, across program boundaries, across machines.
* It simplifies error handling code.
* It makes it easier to build fault-tolerant systems.

.. _arbiter:

The Arbiter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When using pulsar actor layer, you need to use pulsar in **server state**,
that is to say, there will be a centralised **Arbiter** controlling the main
:ref:`event loop <asyncio-event-loop>` in the **main thread** of the
**master process**.
The arbiter is a specialised :class:`.Actor`
which control the life of all :class:`.Actor` and
:ref:`monitors <design-monitor>`

.. _design-arbiter:

To access the arbiter, from the main process, one can use the
:func:`.arbiter` high level function::

    >>> arbiter = pulsar.arbiter()
    >>> arbiter.is_running()
    False

.. _concurrency:

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An actor can be **processed based** (default) or **thread based** and control
at least one running :ref:`event loop <asyncio-event-loop>`.
To obtain the actor controlling the current thread::

    actor = pulsar.get_actor()

When a new processed-based actor is created, a new process is started and the
actor takes control of the main thread of that new process. On the other hand,
thread-based actors always exist in the master process (the same process
as the arbiter) and control threads other than the main thread.

An :class:`.Actor` can control more than one thread if it needs to, via the
:meth:`~.Actor.executor` as explained in the :ref:`CPU bound <cpubound>`
paragraph.
The actor :ref:`event loop <asyncio-event-loop>` is installed in all threads
controlled by the actor so that when the :func:`~asyncio.get_event_loop`
function is invoked on these threads it returns the event loop of
the controlling actor.

.. _actor-io-thread:

.. note::

    Regardless of the type of concurrency, an actor always controls at least
    one thread, the **actor io thread**. In the case of process-based actors
    this thread is the main thread of the actor process.

An actor is a :ref:`async object <async-object>` and therefore it has
a :attr:`~.Actor._loop`
attribute, which can be used to register handlers on file descriptors.
The :attr:`.Actor._loop` is created just after forking (or after the
actor's thread starts for thread-based actors).

.. _iobound:

IO-bound
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most common usage for an :class:`.Actor` is to handle Input/Output
events on file descriptors. An :attr:`.Actor._loop` tells
the operating system (through ``epoll`` or ``select``) that it should be notified
when a new connection is made, and then it goes to sleep.
Serving the new request should occur as fast as possible so that other
connections can be served simultaneously.

.. _cpubound:

CPU-bound
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way for an actor to function is to use its :meth:`~.Actor.executor`
to perform CPU intensive operations, such as calculations, data manipulation
or whatever you need them to do.
CPU-bound :class:`.Actor` have the following properties:

.. _request-loop:

* Their :attr:`.Actor._loop` listen for requests on file descriptors
  as usual and it is running (and installed) in the
  :ref:`actor io thread <actor-io-thread>` as usual.
* The threads in the :meth:`~.Actor.executor` install an additional
  event loop which listen for events on a message queue.
  Pulsar refers to this specialised event loop as the **request loop** and
  it is an instance of :class:`.QueueEventLoop`.

.. note::

    A CPU-bound actor controls more than one thread, the :ref:`IO thread <actor-io-thread>`
    which runs the actor main event loop for listening to events on file descriptors and
    one or more threads for performing CPU-intensive calculations. These CPU-threads
    have installed two events loops: the event loop running on the
    :ref:`IO thread <actor-io-thread>` and the :ref:`request-loop <request-loop>`.


.. _actor-periodic-task:

Periodic task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :class:`.Actor`, including the :class:`.Arbiter` and :class:`.Monitor`,
perform one crucial periodic task at given intervals. The next
call of the task is stored in the :attr:`.Actor.next_periodic_task`
attribute.

Periodic task are implemented by the :meth:`Concurrency.periodic_task` method.

.. _design-spawning:

Spawning
==============

Spawning a new actor is achieved via the :func:`.spawn` function::

    from pulsar import spawn

    def task(actor, exc=None):
        # do something useful here
        ...

    ap = spawn(periodic_task=task)

The value returned by :func:`.spawn` is an :class:`.ActorProxyFuture`,
a specialised :class:`~asyncio.Future` with the :attr:`., which has the actor id ``aid``
and it is called back once the remote actor has started.
The callback will be an :class:`.ActorProxy`, a lightweight proxy
for the remote actor.

When spawning from an actor other than the :ref:`arbiter <design-arbiter>`,
the workflow of the :func:`.spawn` function is as follow:

* :func:`.send` a message to the :ref:`arbiter <design-arbiter>` to spawn
  a new actor.
* The arbiter spawn the actor and wait for the actor's
  :ref:`handshake <handshake>`. Once the hand shake is done, it sends the
  response (the :class:`.ActorProxy` of the
  spawned actor) to the original actor.

.. _handshake:

Handshake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The actor **hand-shake** is the mechanism with which an :class:`.Actor`
register its :ref:`mailbox address <tutorials-messages>` with its manager.
The actor manager is either a :class:`.Monitor` or the
:ref:`arbiter <design-arbiter>` depending on which spawned the actor.

The handshake occurs when the monitor receives, for the first time,
the actor :ref:`notify message <actor_notify_command>`.

For the curious, the handshake is responsible for setting the
:attr:`.ActorProxyMonitor.mailbox` attribute.

If the hand-shake fails, the spawned actor will eventually stop.


.. _actor-hooks:

Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An :class:`.Actor` exposes three :ref:`one time events <one-time-event>`
which can be used to customise its behaviour and two
:ref:`many times event <many-times-event>` used when accessing actor
information and when the actor spawn other actors.
Hooks are passed as key-valued parameters to the :func:`.spawn` function.

**start**

Fired just after the actor has received the
:ref:`hand-shake from its monitor <handshake>`. This hook can be used to setup
the application and register event handlers. For example, the
:ref:`socket server application <apps-socket>` creates the server and register
its file descriptor with the :attr:`.Actor._loop`.

This snippet spawns a new actor which starts an
:ref:`Echo server <tutorials-writing-clients>`::

    from functools import partial

    from pulsar import spawn, TcpServer

    def create_echo_server(address, actor, _):
        '''Starts an echo server on a newly spawn actor'''
        server = TcpServer(actor.event_loop, address[0], address[1],
                           EchoServerProtocol)
        yield server.start_serving()
        actor.servers['echo'] = server
        actor.extra['echo-address'] = server.address

    proxy = spawn(start=partial(create_echo_server, 'localhost:9898'))

The :class:`.EchoServerProtocol` is introduced in the
:ref:`echo server and client tutorial <tutorials-writing-clients>`.

**stopping**

Fired when the :class:`.Actor` starts stopping.

**periodic_task**

Fired at every actor periodic task (More docs here)

**on_info**

Fired every time the actor status information is accessed via the
:ref:`info command <actor_info_command>`::

    def extra_info(actor, info=None):
        info['message'] = 'Hello'

    proxy = spawn(on_info=extra_info)

The hook must accept the actor as first parameter and the ``key-valued``
parameter ``info`` (a dictionary).

**on_params**

Fired every time an actor is about to spawn another actor. It can be used to
add additional key-valued parameters passed to the :func:`.spawn`
function.

.. _actor_commands:

Commands
===============

An :class:`.Actor` communicates with another remote :class:`.Actor` by *sending*
an **action** to perform. This action takes the form of a **command** name and
optional positional and key-valued parameters. It is possible to add new
commands via the :class:`.command` decorator as explained in the
:ref:`api documentation <api-remote_commands>`.


ping
~~~~~~~~~

Ping the remote actor ``abcd`` and receive an asynchronous ``pong``::

    send('abcd', 'ping')


echo
~~~~~~~~~~~

received an asynchronous echo from a remote actor ``abcd``::

    send('abcd', 'echo', 'Hello!')


.. _actor_info_command:

info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request information about a remote actor ``abcd``::

    send('abcd', 'info')

The asynchronous result will be called back with the dictionary returned
by the :meth:`.Actor.info` method.

.. _actor_notify_command:

notify
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message is used periodically by actors, to notify their manager. If an
actor fails to notify itself on a regular basis, its manager will shut it down.
The first ``notify`` message is sent to the manager as soon as the actor is up
and running so that the :ref:`handshake <handshake>` can occur.


.. _actor_run_command:

run
~~~~~~~~~~

Run a function on a remote actor. The function must accept actor as its
initial parameter::

    def dosomething(actor, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    send('monitor', 'run', dosomething, *args, **kwargs)


.. _actor_stop_command:

stop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tell the remote actor ``abc`` to gracefully shutdown::

    send('abc', 'stop')

.. _design-monitor:

Monitors
==============

Monitors are specialised actors which share the :ref:`arbiter <design-arbiter>`
event loop and therefore they live in the main thread of the master process
of your application.

TODO: more docs

.. _exception-design:

Exceptions
=====================

There are two categories of exceptions in Python: those that derive from the
:class:`Exception` class and those that derive from :class:`BaseException`.
Exceptions deriving from Exception will generally be caught and handled
appropriately; for example, they will be passed through by a
:class:`~asyncio.Future`,
and they will be logged and ignored when they occur in a callback.

However, exceptions deriving only from BaseException are never caught,
and will usually cause the program to terminate with a traceback.
(Examples of this category include KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit;
it is usually unwise to treat these the same as most other exceptions.)


.. _design-application:

Application Framework
=============================

To aid the development of applications running on top of pulsar concurrent
framework, the library ships with the :class:`.Application` class.
