Personal Cloud Storages API abstracts providers and gives
a uniform API to access several personal cloud storages. As of today,
the following providers are supported:
`Dropbox <https://www.dropbox.com>`__,
`hubiC <https://hubic.com>`__,
`Google Drive <http://www.google.com/drive/>`__,
`CloudMe <https://www.cloudme.com>`__.

API provides the following methods:

-  list/create/delete folder
-  upload/download/delete blob (a blob is a regular file)
-  inquire about user and about used/available storage quota.

The API is available in many languages (Java, android and Python 2.7).

Some samples programs showing how to use pcs\_api are availables in the repository ``samples`` directory.
