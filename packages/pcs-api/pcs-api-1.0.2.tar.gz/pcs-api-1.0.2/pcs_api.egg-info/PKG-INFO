Description: 
        Personal Cloud Storages API abstracts providers and gives
        a uniform API to access several personal cloud storages. As of today,
        the following providers are supported:
        `Dropbox <https://www.dropbox.com>`__,
        `hubiC <https://hubic.com>`__,
        `Google Drive <http://www.google.com/drive/>`__,
        `CloudMe <https://www.cloudme.com>`__.
        
        API provides the following methods:
        
        -  list/create/delete folder
        -  upload/download/delete blob (a blob is a regular file)
        -  inquire about user and about used/available storage quota.
        
        The API is available in many languages (Java, android and Python 2.7).
        
        Some samples programs showing how to use pcs\_api are availables in the repository ``samples`` directory.
