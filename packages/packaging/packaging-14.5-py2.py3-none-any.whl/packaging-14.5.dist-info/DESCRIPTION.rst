Changelog
=========


14.5 - 2014-12-17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Normalize release candidates as ``rc`` instead of ``c``.

* Expose the ``VERSION_PATTERN`` constant, a regular expression matching
  a valid version.


14.4 - 2014-12-15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Ensure that versions are normalized before comparison when used in a
  specifier with a less than (``<``) or greater than (``>``) operator.


14.3 - 2014-11-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Refactor specifier support so that it can sanely
  handle legacy specifiers as well as PEP 440 specifiers.

* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Move the specifier support out of
  ``packaging.version`` into ``packaging.specifiers``.


14.2 - 2014-09-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add prerelease support to ``Specifier``.
* Remove the ability to do ``item in Specifier()`` and replace it with
  ``Specifier().contains(item)`` in order to allow flags that signal if a
  prerelease should be accepted or not.
* Add a method ``Specifier().filter()`` which will take an iterable and returns
  an iterable with items that do not match the specifier filtered out.


14.1 - 2014-09-08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Allow ``LegacyVersion`` and ``Version`` to be sorted together.
* Add ``packaging.version.parse()`` to enable easily parsing a version string
  as either a ``Version`` or a ``LegacyVersion`` depending on it's PEP 440
  validity.


14.0 - 2014-09-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Initial release.
