bearlib

A simple collection of helper routines that I use in a lot of projects.

I used to just copy the directory into each project...

yes, a build/release person was breaking *all* the rules - *sigh*

Config
======

A dictionary based config class::

    c = Config({ 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': {'d': 1}}
    print("c.a =", c.a)
    print("c.c.d" =", c.c.d)

generates::

    c.a = 1
    c.c.d = 1

It also has three helper methods::

    fromDict(dictionary)
    fromJson(filename)
    fromEtcd(host='127.0.0.1', port=4001, base='/')

fromDict() walks thru the keys of the given dictionary recursively and adds them
to the object. Any key found that has a list or dictionary value is handled with
instances of Config created as needed.

fromJson() uses json.load() to process the given filename and then calls fromDict()
to store the values.

fromEtcd() walks the directory tree at the base location in the etcd server, builds
a dictionary and then passes that to fromDict() for storage.

Install
=======
from PyPI::

    pip install bearlib

from git::

    cd /base/of/your/virtualenv
    pip install -e git+https://github.com/bear/bearlib.git#egg=bearlib

to update the from-git install:

    cd /base/of/your/virtualenv
    pip install --upgrade -e git+https://github.com/bear/bearlib.git#egg=bearlib

Tests
=====
>From the source directory::

    make test
