        Introduction
        ============
        
        The TransitionButtons add-on is a simple plugin for the Plone platform 
        to make the state-change buttons in the edit bar more visibile. 
        It just adds a small portlet-like box with 
        very obvious buttons to publish/retract/etc the current document, assuming
        the user has rights to do so.
